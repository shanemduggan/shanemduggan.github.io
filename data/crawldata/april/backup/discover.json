Laced with musical sequences and cinematic style, ELEVATOR is a comedic and emotional ride into the human psyche and asks the fundamental question: who are you behind closed doors?","locationName":"Coast Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/elevator-8","date":"April 9","address":"8325 Santa Monica Blvd.  CA 90069","type":"Arts & Theater"},{"name":"Los Angeles Lakers v Minnesota Timberwolves","summary":"Los Angeles Lakers v Minnesota Timberwolves","locationName":"STAPLES Center","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/los-angeles-lakers-v-minnesota-timberwolves","date":"April 9","address":"1111 S.

Hardly a purist, Wilder has described the music he makes as, \"rock for roots fans and roots for rock fans.\" His 10 albums have solidified his reputation as one of roots rock's truest voices. His engaging personality led him to become one of America's first Satellite DJs on XM Radio.

Set to the searing highs and lows of Kanye West’s gospel-inspired hip-hop track, “Ultralight Beam,” Love Is The Message is a masterful convergence of found footage that traces African-American identity through a vast spectrum of contemporary imagery. From photographs of civil rights leaders watermarked with “Getty Images” to helicopter views of the LA Riots to a wave of bodies dancing to “The Dougie,” the meticulously edited 7-minute video suspends viewers in a swelling, emotional montage that is a testament to Jafa’s profound ability to mine, scrutinize, and reclaim media’s representational modes and strategies. Alongside segments of familiar Black icons and historic events are also scenes featuring lesser known figures: anonymous bodies in various states of elation and despair. Excerpts from Jafa’s own stunning documentary film, Dreams are Colder than Death (2012) inflects a personal dimension to imagery mostly drawn from news media, television and the Internet. In this pointed inclusion, Jafa discloses both his vulnerability and authority as an artist—what it means to contribute to the vast and complex terrain of Black representation. While Love Is The Message poignantly embodies the artist’s desire to create a cinema that “replicates the power, beauty and alienation of Black Music,” it is also a reminder that the collective multitude defining Blackness is comprised of singular individuals, manifold identities and their unaccountable differences.","locationName":"MOCA","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/arthur-jafa-love-message-message-death","date":"April 10","address":"250 South Grand Avenue Los Angeles CA 90012","type":"Museums & Galleries"},{"name":"Hanging with Harris: David Lentz at The Hungry Cat","summary":"Celebrated culinary MC and fundraising auctioneer Billy Harris announces his new dinner series Hanging with Harris, a lineup of eight intimate, multi-course dining events taking place throughout Los Angeles this February through May.

Marshall’s figurative paintings have been joyful in their consistent portrayal of African Americans. The now nearly 600 year history of painting contains remarkably few African American painters and even fewer representations of black people. Marshall, a child of the civil rights era, set out to redress this absence. “You can’t be born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1955 and grow up in South Central [Los Angeles] near the Black Panthers headquarters,” Marshall has said, “and not feel like you’ve got some kind of social responsibility. You can’t move to Watts in 1963 and not speak about it.

In 2022, American Jews face an increasingly unsafe and anti-Semitic landscape at home. Against this backdrop, the Jacobson family gathers for Passover in Los Angeles. But their immediate problems are more personal than political, with the three adult children, Mo, Edith, and Jacob, in various states of crisis, the result, each claims, of a lifetime of mistreatment by their father, Julian. The siblings have begun to suspect that Julian is hastening their mother Roz's demise, and years of resentment boil over as they debate whether to go through with the real reason for their reunion: an ill-considered plot to end their father's iron rule for good. That is, if they can put their bickering, grudges, festering relationships, and distrust of one another aside long enough to act. And God help them if their mother finds out . . .   Tell Me How This Ends Well presents a blistering and prescient vision of the near future, turning the exploits of one very funny, very troubled family into a rare and compelling exploration of the state of America, and what it could become.","locationName":"","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/tell-me-how-ends-well","date":"April 12","type":"Arts & Theatre"},{"name":"My British Invasion","summary":"Harold Bronson discusses and signs My British Invasion.

Prophet explains, \"One day we were sitting in my so-called office South of Market listening to LPs, when out of frustration I picked up a guitar and shouted, 'I hear that record crackle, the needle skips and jumps!' and klipschutz shot back, 'Bobby Fuller died for your sins!'\" Who is Bobby Fuller? He's the star of the ultimate Rock and Roll Babylon feel-bad story. Prophet realizes that the title track makes a heavy claim, and laughs at the suggestion that it might shine new light on the mystery long surrounding Fuller's early demise. Fuller, who migrated from El Paso to L.A. in the early 1960s, has been described as \"a greaser in a world of Beach Boy bangs and Beatle boots, hopelessly out of step with the times.\" Found dead in his car at the age of 23, to a devoted coterie of fans, old and new, he'll always remain the skinny guy singing \"I Fought the Law\" on countless teen dance TV shows and radio playlists. Ruled a suicide, his death has haunted investigators since 1966. \"Some resolution would be nice,\" Prophet says, \"but I run a band, not a Cold Case squad.\" In conjunction with the release of his latest album, the GRAMMY Museum welcomes San Francisco-based singer/songwriter, guitarist and producer, Chuck Prophet, to the Clive Davis Theatre for an intimate conversation on his new music, followed by a special performance. The evening will be hosted by Scott Goldman, Vice President of the GRAMMY Foundation and MusiCares.","locationName":"GRAMMY Museum","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/drop-chuck-prophet","date":"April 13","address":"A245, 800 West Olympic Boulevard Los Angeles CA","type":"Museums & Galleries"},{"name":"Discovering Kosher/Soul","summary":"Michael W.

Free/all-ages show. Their new album, Gravedigging, is out March 31st on Innovative Leisure. Meet them and get the Gravedigging CD or LP signed by the band after the show. Playing live at The Wayfarer (Costa Mesa) 3/31 and The Observatory (Santa Ana) 4/8.\"It’s rare that a band can cohesively integrate dreamy '50s and '60s rock into the standard garage rock structure with finesse.\" - The BaitshopThe Buttertones’ Gravedigging is more a movie waiting to happen than an album—or a soundtrack just waiting to inspire a movie, with scene after scene of action, tension and release set to a sound that takes everything good and true about American music before the Beatles prettied it up (surf, sweet soul, the boss saxophone-overdrive garage of the Northwest wailers like the Sonics) and matches it to punk energy, post-punk precision and the kind of personality that blows the circuit-breakers at a backyard party. (Which actually happened, of course.) They’ve even got casting suggestions if anyone wants to start filming—like Willem DeFoe, Winona Ryder, Lucy Liu, and Tommy Wiseau in as many roles as possible. Says guitarist Dakota Boettcher: “We all love movies so much. When you listen to a soundtrack, it has peaks and it has lows, but it’s a whole journey. That’s what we want to do. We want you to go on a journey.”The Buttertones started their own journey in 2011 as three music school misfits (or drinking buddies, they say) in the heart of Hollywood, happy to learn how to to play, produce and perform but less excited about frequent go-nowhere conversations with classmates who had little interest in either the past or the future of music. So that’s why bassist Sean Redman (also a former member of Cherry Glazerr) felt like he’d lucked out when he found guitarist/singer Richard Araiza and drummer/polyinstrumentalist Modesto ‘Cobi’ Cobiån: “Cobi and Richard were the first guys I met where I thought they knew what they were talking about,” he says. “They had good influences—they weren’t just trying to pander.”Their first rehearsals were in a Hollywood bedroom where Redman was living on an air mattress, then Araiza finally locked down Boettcher—who he’d often see responding to the same casting calls as he did—to replace another guitarist who was transitioning back to family life even as the Buttertones prepared their debut release, a self-titled cassette on L.A.’s garage-pop Lolipop label. Then they absorbed sax player London Guzmån (formerly in Long Beach’s Wild Pack of Canaries with breakout local Rudy De Anda) after spotting him at a local DJ night, recruiting him for their sophomore album American Brunch—and discovering the kind chemistry they didn't know they were missing. Says Araiza: “We’re proud to be a legit band. It’s a very collaborative process—we rely on each other. I feel that’s rare nowadays, especially with rock bands.”When it came time to make Gravedigging—the follow-up to a special issue 8” for Innovative, which ended up pulling them aboard the label full-time—they knew it was time to go deeper and get dirtier. Recorded at Jazzcats studio in Long Beach—home-away-from-home to fellow Innovative Leisure artists Hanni El Khatib, Tijuana Panthers, Wall of Death and more—in the spring of 2016, the sessions were supercharged with hard-won live experience from endless street-level shows and relentless midnight-to-six rehearsals at the Buttertones lock-out, then focused even further by the insight and vision of producer Jonny Bell. (“Jonny pushed us like crazy,” says Boettcher. “He had so many ideas all he time.”)It kicks off with “Pistol Whip” and “Sadie’s A Sadist,” twin tales of love and crime that match outré Dangerhouse Records punk (the dirty surf of the Alleycats, the slash-and-burn sax of the Deadbeats) to an urgent rock ‘n’ roll rhythm section and lyrics about what happens when you get into something you can’t get out of. “Neon Cowboy” is a weird-Western Wall of Voodoo take on that expansive Ennio Morricone soundtrack sound, then “I Ran Away” is heartbroken East Side Story sweet soul and “Geisha’s Gaze” is a sleazy popcorn-style R&B slow burner. It’s zig-zag through the wild parts of music—the kind of road trip that Iggy Pop was on in Repo Man or the kind where Lux Interior picked up Poison Ivy hitchhiking—and it ends with a climax and a cliffhanger both. That's the nervous-but-nasty title track “Gravediggin’,” a pedal-to-the-metal instrumental that goes blasting over the edge of the world into a dazed slow-mo fade, with just enough time between freefall and impact for Araiza to sing, “I've been treading my way through another haze / Tossed my heart to the wind …” Think of it this way: you might not yet know how the band that made Gravediggin’ is going to land—but you know it’s going to hit hard.","locationName":"Amoeba Hollywood","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/buttertones-live-performance-signing-free-all-ages","date":"April 13","address":"6400 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles CA 90028","type":"Music"},{"name":"Jackknife Comedy L.A.","summary":"The popular NYC comedy show JACKKNIFE COMEDY is coming to LA for ONE NIGHT ONLY on Thursday April 13th at 7pm at the NerdMelt Showroom!","locationName":"NerdMelt Showroom","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/jackknife-comedy-la","date":"April 13","address":"7522 W.

Set to the searing highs and lows of Kanye West’s gospel-inspired hip-hop track, “Ultralight Beam,” Love Is The Message is a masterful convergence of found footage that traces African-American identity through a vast spectrum of contemporary imagery. From photographs of civil rights leaders watermarked with “Getty Images” to helicopter views of the LA Riots to a wave of bodies dancing to “The Dougie,” the meticulously edited 7-minute video suspends viewers in a swelling, emotional montage that is a testament to Jafa’s profound ability to mine, scrutinize, and reclaim media’s representational modes and strategies. Alongside segments of familiar Black icons and historic events are also scenes featuring lesser known figures: anonymous bodies in various states of elation and despair. Excerpts from Jafa’s own stunning documentary film, Dreams are Colder than Death (2012) inflects a personal dimension to imagery mostly drawn from news media, television and the Internet. In this pointed inclusion, Jafa discloses both his vulnerability and authority as an artist—what it means to contribute to the vast and complex terrain of Black representation. While Love Is The Message poignantly embodies the artist’s desire to create a cinema that “replicates the power, beauty and alienation of Black Music,” it is also a reminder that the collective multitude defining Blackness is comprised of singular individuals, manifold identities and their unaccountable differences.","locationName":"MOCA","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/arthur-jafa-love-message-message-death-0","date":"April 18","address":"250 South Grand Avenue Los Angeles CA 90012","type":"Museums & Galleries"},{"name":"Evening w/ Benjamin Millepied","summary":"We are delighted to welcome Benjamin Millepied, Founder of the L.A.

Marshall’s figurative paintings have been joyful in their consistent portrayal of African Americans. The now nearly 600 year history of painting contains remarkably few African American painters and even fewer representations of black people. Marshall, a child of the civil rights era, set out to redress this absence. “You can’t be born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1955 and grow up in South Central [Los Angeles] near the Black Panthers headquarters,” Marshall has said, “and not feel like you’ve got some kind of social responsibility. You can’t move to Watts in 1963 and not speak about it.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

The son of an actress (Lucia Bosè) and a bullfighter (Luis Miguel Dominguín), Bosé grew up in the arts -- with Picasso and Ernest Hemingway among his family friends. He often traveled from his homeland of Panama to Milan, New York, London, Paris, and Madrid. He made his film debut at the age of 15, and at age 21, he began his singing career, which eventually led to international pop stardom. Between 1977 and 1982, he recorded several albums for CBS, but it wasn't until 1985 that he had his first hit with \"Bandido.\" A year later, he signed with Warner Bros., which led to more introspective LPs like Salamandra, which was overseen by producer Celso Valli (well known for with work with Eros Ramazzotti). This production was followed by XXX, Los Chicos No Lloran, and Directo '90, a live recording compiling many of the artist's hits. In 1993, Bosé's music moved into a more political vein with the album Bajo el Signo de Cain, which addressed such issues as Yugoslavia's political turmoil, ecological concerns, and aspects of his stardom. It ended up being his first platinum album. With an increasingly powerful international profile as a singer and actor, he released Laberinto in 1995 and went on a 125-concert tour of Spain and Latin America to support the album. This was followed in 1997 by 11 Maneras de Ponerse un Sombrero and, in 1999, a greatest hits album, Lo Mejor de Bosé. In the following decade, Bosé's popularity continued undiminished; he released four more studio albums and two live albums. In 2000 he recorded Girados, a collaborative double live album with Ana Torroja. 2002's Sereno won him a Latin Grammy for Best Male Pop Performance, while 2005's Velvetina saw him stepping outside the box to experiment with electronic dance-pop (even the cover was a clear homage to Kraftwerk). In 2007, celebrating 30 years in the business, he made the album Papito, where numerous stars of Latin music -- including huge names like Juanes, Shakira, Ricky Martin and Laura Pausini -- joined him in re-recording duet versions of some of his biggest hits. A younger listenership was turned on to his music by the single \"Como un Lobo,\" featuring his niece Bimba Bosé, herself a successful singer and model. He then took the album on the road, resulting in the live effort Papitour. His 18th studio album, Cardio, was issued in 2010. Produced by Bosé with Nicolas Sorin, it spent all of the spring and summer on the charts in Spain, as well as Mexico and Italy. Also in 2010, he was awarded honorary Colombian citizenship for his efforts toward peace in that country. Amo, released in 2014, became a Top Five success in Spain, and his MTV Unplugged set from 2016 hit number one in both Spain and Mexico. During his career as an international pop star, Bosé has portrayed a cross dresser in Pedro Almodovar's High Heels, worked with Andy Warhol on two videos, and witnessed the banning of his video \"No Encuentro un Momento Pa' Olvidar\" for its controversial sexual imagery. Defying the contemporary formula for pop success, his music has been described as a global fusion of many musical influences. At the center of this is all the passion and expression of a Latin artist, and Miguel Bosé has constantly incorporated more diverse musical elements than many of the genre's crossover pop stars. ~ Zac Johnson & John D.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21.

His congregation was racially integrated, and he was a much-lauded leader in the contemporary civil rights movement. Eventually, Jones moved his church, Peoples Temple, to northern California. He became involved in electoral politics, and soon was a prominent Bay Area leader.  In this riveting narrative, Jeff Guinn examines Jones's life, from his extramarital affairs, drug use, and fraudulent faith healing to the fraught decision to move almost a thousand of his followers to a settlement in the jungles of Guyana in South America. Guinn provides stunning new details of the events leading to the fatal day in November, 1978 when more than nine hundred people died--including almost three hundred infants and children--after being ordered to swallow a cyanide-laced drink.  Guinn examined thousands of pages of FBI files on the case, including material released during the course of his research. He traveled to Jones's Indiana hometown, where he spoke to people never previously interviewed, and uncovered fresh information from Jonestown survivors. He even visited the Jonestown site with the same pilot who flew there the day that Congressman Leo Ryan was murdered on Jones's orders. The Road to Jonestown is the definitive book about Jim Jones and the events that led to the tragedy at Jonestown.  (Simon & Schuster)","locationName":"","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/jeff-guinn-road-jonestown","date":"April 24","type":"Miscellaneous"},{"name":"Allergies: The Flower Show","summary":"ALLERGIES: THE FLOWER SHOW - APRIL 8TH – MAY 4TH AT SUGARMYNT GALLERY IN SOUTH PASADENA.This is our flower show with a twist, the twist being none of the flowers are real.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings.

His songs have been recorded by our finest voices including Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Glen Campbell, and Art Garfunkel. Webb is the only artist to have received GRAMMY Awards for music, lyrics and orchestration and was the youngest man ever inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In his new book, The Cake and The Rain: A Memoir, Webb delivers a snapshot of his life from 1955 to 1970, from simple farm in Oklahoma to fast and fantastical Los Angeles, from the crucible of his family to the top of his longed-for profession. The Cake and The Rain is a surprising and unusual book: Webb's talent as a writer and storyteller is here on every page. His book is rich with a sense of time and place, and with the voices of characters, vanished and living, famous and not, but all intimately involved with him in his youth, when life seemed nothing more than a party and Webb the eternal guest of honor. Webb's first book, Tunesmith: The Art of Songwriting is considered a bible among musicians. The GRAMMY Museum welcomes Jimmy Webb for a discussion on his extraordinary career and new memoir The Cake and The Rain. The evening will be hosted by GRAMMY Foundation Vice President Scott Goldman and will be followed by an intimate performance. A book signing will be held after the program.","locationName":"GRAMMY Museum","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/evening-jimmy-webb","date":"April 26","address":"A245, 800 West Olympic Boulevard Los Angeles CA","type":"Music"},{"name":"Allergies: The Flower Show","summary":"ALLERGIES: THE FLOWER SHOW - APRIL 8TH – MAY 4TH AT SUGARMYNT GALLERY IN SOUTH PASADENA.This is our flower show with a twist, the twist being none of the flowers are real.

Decades later, Landau rediscovered his Kodachromes , which ended up being the most extensive collection of photographs to document this remarkable Sunset Strip phenomenon. Inspired, he interviewed the artists, record producers, and designers who brought the billboards to life, lending fresh insight to the culture of the day.  It’s all chronicled in Landau’s book Rock ‘N’ Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip (Angel City Press). In conjunction with a public art exhibit consisting of 10 large format versions of Robert Landau's photos; this talk is presented by the City of West Hollywood through Weho Arts and WeHo Reads (www.weho.org/arts) as part of  'There's Something Happening Here...' a year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the counterculture era on the Sunset Strip.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21.

As well as high comedy and romance, The Magic Flute possesses a serious ethical side, and we hear both these qualities in its remarkable overture. Composed in 1773, when Mozart was only 17 years old, the evening continues with the composer’s Symphony #25, with wide-leap melodic lines and engaging syncopation. The second half of the concert features Mozart’s iconic Requiem in D Minor. The Requiem was composed in 1791, but remained unfinished at the time of Mozart’s death. Stories abound as factiously portrayed in the 1984 film, Amadeus, concerning who actually completed it, though most scholars attribute its final iteration to Suessmayer in 1792. Though some of the facts put forth in that film may not be entirely accurate, the genius of Mozart’s Requiem is irrefutable. The choral component of the work will be fulfilled by the Symphony’s artistic partner, Long Beach Camerata Singers, for which Istad serves as Artistic Director.","locationName":"Terrace Theater","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/long-beach-symphony-evening-mozart","date":"April 29","address":"300 E.

The Hutchins Consort will be performing music from some of these composers who contributed to enrich the world music scene, like Bartok, Schoenberg, Stravinsky or Zeisl.  The Hutchins Consort plays on the eight scaled violins designed and built by luthier Dr. Carleen Hutchins, whose research into the acoustic properties of string instruments resulted in an innovative process called free-plate tuning; a precise method of refining the top and back plates of a violin before it is assembled to bring it to peak acoustic performance. The fruits of her labor are the eight Hutchins violins, ranging in size from the 18.5-inch treble to the 7.2-foot contrabass. Like all violins, these instruments capture the emotional element of the music. But they have the additional advantage of being crafted as a complete set with the same harmonic DNA  giving them the ability to produce a unique array of sounds that add a new dimension to the works they perform.","locationName":"St. Augustine by-the-Sea","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/hutchins-consort-immigrants","date":"April 29","address":"1227 Fourth Street, Santa Monica  CA 90401","type":"Music"},{"name":"Elevator","summary":"Michael Leoni’s celebrated play ELEVATOR returns to Los Angeles for a special limited engagement at The Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood from March 23 – April 30, 2017.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

When seven strangers—a CEO Woman, Business Man, Office Temp, Hot Girl, Musician, Maintenance Man and Goth Girl—get stuck in an elevator, it’s only a matter of time before the truth comes out. When forced together, given nothing but four walls and each other, these archetypes prove to be anything but ‘typical.’ Their preconceived notions, stereotypes and judgments are challenged at every turn, as one by one, they shed their masks and reveal their truths. Laced with musical sequences and cinematic style, ELEVATOR is a comedic and emotional ride into the human psyche and asks the fundamental question: who are you behind closed doors?","locationName":"Coast Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/elevator-17","date":"April 30","address":"8325 Santa Monica Blvd.  CA 90069","type":"Arts & Theater"},{"name":"ACB Presents Dance + Design","summary":"The Naked Souls of Kings and Queens","locationName":"American Contemporary Ballet","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/acb-presents-dance-design-5","date":"April 30","address":"700 S.
