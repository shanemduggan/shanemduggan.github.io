SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 7","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 7","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 8","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be.

The second biennial exhibition \"Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video\" presents the work of dozens of artists who explore Iranian culture and heritage. An international jury of citizen journalists, archivists and storytellers — who are connected to Iran by ancestry or simple admiration of its culture — selected work by emerging and midcareer artists to reflect the diversity of contemporary Iranian life. The resulting show presents a culture that is deeply connected to history yet constantly evolving and very much alive.","locationName":"Craft & Folk Art Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/focus-iran-2-contemporary-photography-and-video-7852914","date":"April 8","type":"Art Museums Arts & Culture","address":"5814 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-937-4230"},{"name":"\"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters\"","summary":"By Gwynedd Stuart In 1997, Mexico City­–based rock photographer Fernando Aceves was contacted by a concert promoter and offered the chance to document David Bowie's first and only visit to Mexico.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 8","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"April 8","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 8","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 8","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 9","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 9","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly. As part of as part of McLaughlin’s overdue exhibition at LACMA, the curators installed chairs — made specially by artist Roy McMakin — so you can stay and spend time with the work, as if they’re old friends with whom you need to catch up.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/john-mclaughlin-paintings-total-abstraction-7778495","date":"April 9","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"LIVE LIFE LA Corporate Challenge 2017","summary":"Register now before space fills up for the always fun filled, annual Los Angeles Corporate Challenge LIVE LIFE Sporting Event.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 9","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Sixteen years ago: “I looked down the deep, dark hole. It had a cool, calm blackness that was very alluring. I want to dive into it, travel to where it ends. My breathing was tight but even. I could do this. I pulled back the trigger. Steady, I aimed at my third eye, I felt the bullet inside the chamber and my third eye pull towards each other like magnets…. Out of nowhere, I hear, “How ’bout a cup of tea?” Pearly toned, full of peace, singsong. In the voice there is a feeling of normality, like there is nothing wrong. What a good idea! I ease back the trigger; a torrent of sweat suddenly comes from nowhere and pours down my face. My hands are shaking; I gingerly put the gun down…” Thus began an intimate relationship with Sophia, at that time I considered my Spirit Guide. Sophia guided me to negotiate the mine fields of my mental illnesses, my extreme anger and hate. Today, I recognize Sophia is me, I had came back in time to save myself.

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","locationName":"Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"April 10","type":"Theater","address":"1089 N.

From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited.

The film, which runs just under 50 minutes, is black, white and red, the red matching the exit signs that line the otherwise dark theater. It pays romantic, heavy homage to lots of different things — Voodoo, punk, existential crises, cultural rituals and Care Bears — though mostly it’s about itself. A priestess does a ritual, cursing rolls of film that will later be used to shoot footage we’re watching.

It’s hard to predict just what Hardy has in store from night to night, as she’ll likely improvise cleverly demented songs based on audience suggestions — or, as at a recent appearance at the Redwood, she’ll weave eavesdropped conversations from drunks at the bar into her madcap wordplay. She’ll probably unveil several of the heart-piercing songs of tragedy and romantic longing from her upcoming solo album, Rules, but she’ll counteract the delicate tension of these moody ballads with unexpectedly ribald non sequiturs between songs.","locationName":"The Echo","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/annie-hardy-8068813","date":"April 11","type":"Alternative Grunge Pop Rock Singer-Songwriter","address":"1822 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 11","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 11","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 12","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 12","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"April 12","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Her paintings are composed of subtle earth colors, painterly atmospheric passages and gracefully fluid markings. Taub has developed a personal style that effortlessly moves between abstraction and figuration, creating exquisite work that is refined, confident, and strikingly beautiful. Taub works and re-works images, allowing the final painting to emerge out of a controlled chaos. As she builds up multiple layers she will eventually arrive at a finished painting of perfect balance and harmony. Her finished (and often unfinished) figures pleasantly tease the observer’s eye, suggesting perhaps a pose or a gaze, but leaving final interpretation to the viewer.","locationName":"First Independent Gallery (FIG)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/hilary-taub-recent-work-7552619","date":"April 12","type":"Art Galleries","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., G6 Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-829-0345"},{"name":"Adrian Galysh & August Zadra Acoustic A-Z","summary":"Adrian Galysh and August Zadra play your favorite songs from the 70s, 80s, 90s, and beyond that you'll surely want to sing along with.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 13","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"April 13","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 13","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Developed by Los Angeles Conservancy, the tour guides visitors through one of the city's oldest neighborhoods with many layers of history and diverse communities. The influx of popular culinary hotspots and art galleries, combined with the area's rich history, makes Chinatown one of L.A.'s most exciting neighborhoods. The tour takes visitors to the Central Plaza in the heart of New Chinatown, and includes decades-old shops selling traditional teas, medicines, and Chinese imports; and places of historic importance in the battle for Chinese-American civil rights. The tour highlights dining institutions such as Hop Louie and Empress Pavilion, and the site of Madame Wong's, a hotspot for legendary punk bands in the 1970s and '80s.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 13","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Using his keen talent for focused observation and witty interpretation, Hoekzema has a natural sense when it comes to capturing the essence of his subject. In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings. These are quirky, cheerful and immensely likeable works that will appeal to anyone who appreciates the art of painting.","locationName":"First Independent Gallery (FIG)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/curtis-hoekzema-paintings-6896227","date":"April 13","type":"Art Galleries","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., G6 Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-829-0345"},{"name":"Merican Made Pop-Up","summary":"A pop-up with items from an array of men and women’s lifestyles brands from around the United States, Merican Made features leather bags, apparel, handmade signs or bottle openers.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 14","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 14","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 14","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 14","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Using his keen talent for focused observation and witty interpretation, Hoekzema has a natural sense when it comes to capturing the essence of his subject. In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings. These are quirky, cheerful and immensely likeable works that will appeal to anyone who appreciates the art of painting.","locationName":"First Independent Gallery (FIG)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/curtis-hoekzema-paintings-6896227","date":"April 14","type":"Art Galleries","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., G6 Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-829-0345"},{"name":"Real Mex - Acapulco","summary":"Promotional Event Description Win a Happy Hour at Acapulco!

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","locationName":"Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"April 15","type":"Theater","address":"1089 N.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 15","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 15","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"International Printing Museum","summary":"By Eve Weston Letterpress printing is enjoying a revival, and the International Printing Museum is Mecca for this retro art, boasting the Ernest A.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

In the second film program of the night, NFMLA presents “InFocus: British Cinema,” which shines a spotlight on upcoming directors and producers from the United Kingdom. “Bobby Sands: 66 Days” is a documentary, which follows the story of activist Bobby Sands’ hunger strike and the resulting impact on British-Irish relations. Following that, is a short film block, which centers on portrayals of family and friendship, posing questions about identity and internal conflict. These emerging directors illuminate the diverse range of the human experience, from a veteran’s struggle with PTSD to the strained reconciliation between a young woman and her mother. In the final program of the night, we take you on a journey throughout the United States. These shorts feature of a variety of film genres from dark comedies to suspenseful thrillers to somber Westerns. We follow a border agent’s attempt to try and resolve a messy situation, a man’s journey to find his life’s treasure, and a story about two young girls struggling to survive in the world. Throughout the night, you will have the opportunity to mingle with the filmmakers, industry supporters and film lovers over cocktails and beats at the filmmakers’ lounge adjacent to the private entry of the South Park Center’s 500 seat theater in Downtown Los Angeles.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 15","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 15","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin.

You go in, guided by an attendant, to an empty chair in the middle of the theater. The chairs around it have been moved away. The film, which runs just under 50 minutes, is black, white and red, the red matching the exit signs that line the otherwise dark theater. It pays romantic, heavy homage to lots of different things — Voodoo, punk, existential crises, cultural rituals and Care Bears — though mostly it’s about itself. A priestess does a ritual, cursing rolls of film that will later be used to shoot footage we’re watching. Actress Charlotte Rampling appears at one point wearing a Grumpy Bear suit, though the suit hangs loosely and she appears onstage monologuing over-seriously about the nature of reality, so you might not make the cartoon connection right away.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/loris-greaud-sculpt-7292258","date":"April 15","type":"Art Galleries","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Bar Sinister","summary":"Hollywood's dark-wave bastion and goth dungeon, with resident DJs Amanda Jones, John C & Tommy, plus sexy-sinful displays and aerialist distractions","locationName":"Boardner's","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/bar-sinister-4571562","date":"April 15","type":"Alternative DJ EDM Goth Rock","address":"1652 N.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 16","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 16","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly. As part of as part of McLaughlin’s overdue exhibition at LACMA, the curators installed chairs — made specially by artist Roy McMakin — so you can stay and spend time with the work, as if they’re old friends with whom you need to catch up.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/john-mclaughlin-paintings-total-abstraction-7778495","date":"April 16","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters","summary":"Celebrate the life and legacy of icon David Bowie in a special exhibition of exclusive images by Fernando Aceves of the late, legendary singer-songwriter taken during his historic 1997 Earthling album tour to Mexico City.

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","locationName":"Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"April 17","type":"Theater","address":"1089 N.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 17","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"April 18","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Noah's Ark at the Skirball","summary":"An exhibit aimed at families that includes a floor-to-ceiling wooden ark and animal sculptures.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/noahs-ark-at-the-skirball-4291271","date":"April 18","type":"Museums","address":"2701 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 18","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"April 19","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"April 19","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"The House of Vibe All-Stars","summary":"","locationName":"Harvelle's Santa Monica","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-house-of-vibe-all-stars-4290827","date":"April 19","type":"Music Blues Jazz R&B Rock","address":"1432 Fourth St. Santa Monica, CA 90401 310-395-1676"},{"name":"Marty & Elayne","summary":"","locationName":"The Dresden Restaurant","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/marty-and-elayne-4290756","date":"April 19","type":"Music Jazz Lounge Pop","address":"1760 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 19","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"April 19","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 20","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"April 20","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Last Day of School: The Txt Msg Show / Convoy","summary":"By Stephanie Carrie Anonymous once said, \"You get what you pay for.\" In regards to the McDonald's dollar menu, Anonymous was probably right, but he was dead wrong about the doubleheader improv show at the Upright Citizens Brigade: \"Last Day of School\" and \"Convoy.\" For $5 at 11 p.m. on Thursdays you can see two of the most seasoned and reliably hilarious improv teams in town. \"LDoS\" improvises scenes based on audience text messages. \"Convoy\" asks for a one-word suggestion and wows audiences with the esoteric specificity of its scenes and the \"juxtaposition of the fantastic and mundane,\" as member Alex Berg adroitly put it. \"LDoS\" members have written and performed on shows such as Saturday Night Live, Happy Endings, Comedy Bang Bang and Adult Swim's Newsreaders.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 20","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 21","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

The exhibit features (through May 21 only) two pages of the original document on loan from the National Archives, as well as the Presidential Proclamation 2537 signed on Jan. 14, 1942 that required aliens from Germany, Italy and Japan to register with the U.S. Department of Justice. The display also includes additional historical documents, documentary videos and contemporary artwork by Wendy Maruyama and Mike Saijo.

The second biennial exhibition \"Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video\" presents the work of dozens of artists who explore Iranian culture and heritage. An international jury of citizen journalists, archivists and storytellers — who are connected to Iran by ancestry or simple admiration of its culture — selected work by emerging and midcareer artists to reflect the diversity of contemporary Iranian life. The resulting show presents a culture that is deeply connected to history yet constantly evolving and very much alive.","locationName":"Craft & Folk Art Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/focus-iran-2-contemporary-photography-and-video-7852914","date":"April 21","type":"Art Museums Arts & Culture","address":"5814 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-937-4230"},{"name":"\"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters\"","summary":"By Gwynedd Stuart In 1997, Mexico City­–based rock photographer Fernando Aceves was contacted by a concert promoter and offered the chance to document David Bowie's first and only visit to Mexico.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 21","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"April 21","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"The Los Bar","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Architect Adolf Loos designed his American Bar in Vienna, a fantastic construction with onyx walls and marble floors, in 1903.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"April 21","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 21","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 22","type":"Theater","address":"110 E. Broadway Glendale, CA 91205 818-506-1983"},{"name":"Still Life","summary":"By Deborah Klugman Though it aspires to be profound, Alexander Dinelaris’ aptly titled Still Life can’t transcend its commonplace dialogue or the limitations of an inadequately conceived central character. That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","locationName":"Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"April 22","type":"Theater","address":"1089 N.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 22","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 22","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Taub works and re-works images, allowing the final painting to emerge out of a controlled chaos.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 23","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental.

The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 23","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 23","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 24","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 25","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"April 25","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133"},{"name":"Escape Room LA Premieres The Alchemist","summary":"Magic and adventure await those who choose to enter Escape Room LA’s newest escape room, The Alchemist.

The film, which runs just under 50 minutes, is black, white and red, the red matching the exit signs that line the otherwise dark theater. It pays romantic, heavy homage to lots of different things — Voodoo, punk, existential crises, cultural rituals and Care Bears — though mostly it’s about itself. A priestess does a ritual, cursing rolls of film that will later be used to shoot footage we’re watching.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 26","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"April 26","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133"},{"name":"ABC’s First Official General Hospital Convention","summary":"Television’s original most passionate fans will gather to honor the nation’s longest running soap opera, multi Emmy award winning General Hospital, on March 11-12, 2017 at Los Angeles Marriott Burbank Hotel Convention Center.

The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 27","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 27","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"April 27","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133"},{"name":"Escape Room LA Premieres The Alchemist","summary":"Magic and adventure await those who choose to enter Escape Room LA’s newest escape room, The Alchemist.

In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 28","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 28","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 28","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

It pays romantic, heavy homage to lots of different things — Voodoo, punk, existential crises, cultural rituals and Care Bears — though mostly it’s about itself.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"April 28","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133"},{"name":"ABC’s First Official General Hospital Convention","summary":"Television’s original most passionate fans will gather to honor the nation’s longest running soap opera, multi Emmy award winning General Hospital, on March 11-12, 2017 at Los Angeles Marriott Burbank Hotel Convention Center.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 29","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"April 29","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","address":"601 S.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"April 29","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"April 29","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Dance Yourself Clean","summary":"","locationName":"Short Stop","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dance-yourself-clean-4291223","date":"April 29","type":"Music DJ EDM","address":"1455 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90026 213-482-4942"},{"name":"Reflecting Culture: The Francis E.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 30","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"April 30","type":"Comedy","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 30","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 30","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

Set to the searing highs and lows of Kanye West’s gospel-inspired hip-hop track, “Ultralight Beam,” Love Is The Message is a masterful convergence of found footage that traces African-American identity through a vast spectrum of contemporary imagery. From photographs of civil rights leaders watermarked with “Getty Images” to helicopter views of the LA Riots to a wave of bodies dancing to “The Dougie,” the meticulously edited 7-minute video suspends viewers in a swelling, emotional montage that is a testament to Jafa’s profound ability to mine, scrutinize, and reclaim media’s representational modes and strategies. Alongside segments of familiar Black icons and historic events are also scenes featuring lesser known figures: anonymous bodies in various states of elation and despair. Excerpts from Jafa’s own stunning documentary film, Dreams are Colder than Death (2012) inflects a personal dimension to imagery mostly drawn from news media, television and the Internet. In this pointed inclusion, Jafa discloses both his vulnerability and authority as an artist—what it means to contribute to the vast and complex terrain of Black representation. While Love Is The Message poignantly embodies the artist’s desire to create a cinema that “replicates the power, beauty and alienation of Black Music,” it is also a reminder that the collective multitude defining Blackness is comprised of singular individuals, manifold identities and their unaccountable differences.","locationName":"MOCA","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/arthur-jafa-love-message-message-death","date":"April 10","address":"250 South Grand Avenue Los Angeles CA 90012","type":"Museums & Galleries"},{"name":"Hanging with Harris: David Lentz at The Hungry Cat","summary":"Celebrated culinary MC and fundraising auctioneer Billy Harris announces his new dinner series Hanging with Harris, a lineup of eight intimate, multi-course dining events taking place throughout Los Angeles this February through May.

The siblings have begun to suspect that Julian is hastening their mother Roz's demise, and years of resentment boil over as they debate whether to go through with the real reason for their reunion: an ill-considered plot to end their father's iron rule for good. That is, if they can put their bickering, grudges, festering relationships, and distrust of one another aside long enough to act.

Prophet explains, \"One day we were sitting in my so-called office South of Market listening to LPs, when out of frustration I picked up a guitar and shouted, 'I hear that record crackle, the needle skips and jumps!' and klipschutz shot back, 'Bobby Fuller died for your sins!'\" Who is Bobby Fuller? He's the star of the ultimate Rock and Roll Babylon feel-bad story. Prophet realizes that the title track makes a heavy claim, and laughs at the suggestion that it might shine new light on the mystery long surrounding Fuller's early demise. Fuller, who migrated from El Paso to L.A. in the early 1960s, has been described as \"a greaser in a world of Beach Boy bangs and Beatle boots, hopelessly out of step with the times.\" Found dead in his car at the age of 23, to a devoted coterie of fans, old and new, he'll always remain the skinny guy singing \"I Fought the Law\" on countless teen dance TV shows and radio playlists. Ruled a suicide, his death has haunted investigators since 1966. \"Some resolution would be nice,\" Prophet says, \"but I run a band, not a Cold Case squad.\" In conjunction with the release of his latest album, the GRAMMY Museum welcomes San Francisco-based singer/songwriter, guitarist and producer, Chuck Prophet, to the Clive Davis Theatre for an intimate conversation on his new music, followed by a special performance.

Free/all-ages show. Their new album, Gravedigging, is out March 31st on Innovative Leisure. Meet them and get the Gravedigging CD or LP signed by the band after the show. Playing live at The Wayfarer (Costa Mesa) 3/31 and The Observatory (Santa Ana) 4/8.\"It’s rare that a band can cohesively integrate dreamy '50s and '60s rock into the standard garage rock structure with finesse.\" - The BaitshopThe Buttertones’ Gravedigging is more a movie waiting to happen than an album—or a soundtrack just waiting to inspire a movie, with scene after scene of action, tension and release set to a sound that takes everything good and true about American music before the Beatles prettied it up (surf, sweet soul, the boss saxophone-overdrive garage of the Northwest wailers like the Sonics) and matches it to punk energy, post-punk precision and the kind of personality that blows the circuit-breakers at a backyard party. (Which actually happened, of course.) They’ve even got casting suggestions if anyone wants to start filming—like Willem DeFoe, Winona Ryder, Lucy Liu, and Tommy Wiseau in as many roles as possible. Says guitarist Dakota Boettcher: “We all love movies so much. When you listen to a soundtrack, it has peaks and it has lows, but it’s a whole journey. That’s what we want to do. We want you to go on a journey.”The Buttertones started their own journey in 2011 as three music school misfits (or drinking buddies, they say) in the heart of Hollywood, happy to learn how to to play, produce and perform but less excited about frequent go-nowhere conversations with classmates who had little interest in either the past or the future of music. So that’s why bassist Sean Redman (also a former member of Cherry Glazerr) felt like he’d lucked out when he found guitarist/singer Richard Araiza and drummer/polyinstrumentalist Modesto ‘Cobi’ Cobiån: “Cobi and Richard were the first guys I met where I thought they knew what they were talking about,” he says. “They had good influences—they weren’t just trying to pander.”Their first rehearsals were in a Hollywood bedroom where Redman was living on an air mattress, then Araiza finally locked down Boettcher—who he’d often see responding to the same casting calls as he did—to replace another guitarist who was transitioning back to family life even as the Buttertones prepared their debut release, a self-titled cassette on L.A.’s garage-pop Lolipop label. Then they absorbed sax player London Guzmån (formerly in Long Beach’s Wild Pack of Canaries with breakout local Rudy De Anda) after spotting him at a local DJ night, recruiting him for their sophomore album American Brunch—and discovering the kind chemistry they didn't know they were missing. Says Araiza: “We’re proud to be a legit band. It’s a very collaborative process—we rely on each other. I feel that’s rare nowadays, especially with rock bands.”When it came time to make Gravedigging—the follow-up to a special issue 8” for Innovative, which ended up pulling them aboard the label full-time—they knew it was time to go deeper and get dirtier. Recorded at Jazzcats studio in Long Beach—home-away-from-home to fellow Innovative Leisure artists Hanni El Khatib, Tijuana Panthers, Wall of Death and more—in the spring of 2016, the sessions were supercharged with hard-won live experience from endless street-level shows and relentless midnight-to-six rehearsals at the Buttertones lock-out, then focused even further by the insight and vision of producer Jonny Bell. (“Jonny pushed us like crazy,” says Boettcher. “He had so many ideas all he time.”)It kicks off with “Pistol Whip” and “Sadie’s A Sadist,” twin tales of love and crime that match outré Dangerhouse Records punk (the dirty surf of the Alleycats, the slash-and-burn sax of the Deadbeats) to an urgent rock ‘n’ roll rhythm section and lyrics about what happens when you get into something you can’t get out of. “Neon Cowboy” is a weird-Western Wall of Voodoo take on that expansive Ennio Morricone soundtrack sound, then “I Ran Away” is heartbroken East Side Story sweet soul and “Geisha’s Gaze” is a sleazy popcorn-style R&B slow burner. It’s zig-zag through the wild parts of music—the kind of road trip that Iggy Pop was on in Repo Man or the kind where Lux Interior picked up Poison Ivy hitchhiking—and it ends with a climax and a cliffhanger both. That's the nervous-but-nasty title track “Gravediggin’,” a pedal-to-the-metal instrumental that goes blasting over the edge of the world into a dazed slow-mo fade, with just enough time between freefall and impact for Araiza to sing, “I've been treading my way through another haze / Tossed my heart to the wind …” Think of it this way: you might not yet know how the band that made Gravediggin’ is going to land—but you know it’s going to hit hard.","locationName":"Amoeba Hollywood","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/buttertones-live-performance-signing-free-all-ages","date":"April 13","address":"6400 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles CA 90028","type":"Music"},{"name":"Jackknife Comedy L.A.","summary":"The popular NYC comedy show JACKKNIFE COMEDY is coming to LA for ONE NIGHT ONLY on Thursday April 13th at 7pm at the NerdMelt Showroom!","locationName":"NerdMelt Showroom","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/jackknife-comedy-la","date":"April 13","address":"7522 W.

Dwan was a major force in the international art world yet has received relatively little attention, due in part to the closure of her gallery after only eleven years in 1971 (her Los Angeles space closed in 1967).

Set to the searing highs and lows of Kanye West’s gospel-inspired hip-hop track, “Ultralight Beam,” Love Is The Message is a masterful convergence of found footage that traces African-American identity through a vast spectrum of contemporary imagery. From photographs of civil rights leaders watermarked with “Getty Images” to helicopter views of the LA Riots to a wave of bodies dancing to “The Dougie,” the meticulously edited 7-minute video suspends viewers in a swelling, emotional montage that is a testament to Jafa’s profound ability to mine, scrutinize, and reclaim media’s representational modes and strategies. Alongside segments of familiar Black icons and historic events are also scenes featuring lesser known figures: anonymous bodies in various states of elation and despair. Excerpts from Jafa’s own stunning documentary film, Dreams are Colder than Death (2012) inflects a personal dimension to imagery mostly drawn from news media, television and the Internet. In this pointed inclusion, Jafa discloses both his vulnerability and authority as an artist—what it means to contribute to the vast and complex terrain of Black representation. While Love Is The Message poignantly embodies the artist’s desire to create a cinema that “replicates the power, beauty and alienation of Black Music,” it is also a reminder that the collective multitude defining Blackness is comprised of singular individuals, manifold identities and their unaccountable differences.","locationName":"MOCA","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/arthur-jafa-love-message-message-death-0","date":"April 18","address":"250 South Grand Avenue Los Angeles CA 90012","type":"Museums & Galleries"},{"name":"Evening w/ Benjamin Millepied","summary":"We are delighted to welcome Benjamin Millepied, Founder of the L.A.

The now nearly 600 year history of painting contains remarkably few African American painters and even fewer representations of black people. Marshall, a child of the civil rights era, set out to redress this absence. “You can’t be born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1955 and grow up in South Central [Los Angeles] near the Black Panthers headquarters,” Marshall has said, “and not feel like you’ve got some kind of social responsibility.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

The son of an actress (Lucia Bosè) and a bullfighter (Luis Miguel Dominguín), Bosé grew up in the arts -- with Picasso and Ernest Hemingway among his family friends. He often traveled from his homeland of Panama to Milan, New York, London, Paris, and Madrid. He made his film debut at the age of 15, and at age 21, he began his singing career, which eventually led to international pop stardom. Between 1977 and 1982, he recorded several albums for CBS, but it wasn't until 1985 that he had his first hit with \"Bandido.\" A year later, he signed with Warner Bros., which led to more introspective LPs like Salamandra, which was overseen by producer Celso Valli (well known for with work with Eros Ramazzotti). This production was followed by XXX, Los Chicos No Lloran, and Directo '90, a live recording compiling many of the artist's hits. In 1993, Bosé's music moved into a more political vein with the album Bajo el Signo de Cain, which addressed such issues as Yugoslavia's political turmoil, ecological concerns, and aspects of his stardom. It ended up being his first platinum album. With an increasingly powerful international profile as a singer and actor, he released Laberinto in 1995 and went on a 125-concert tour of Spain and Latin America to support the album. This was followed in 1997 by 11 Maneras de Ponerse un Sombrero and, in 1999, a greatest hits album, Lo Mejor de Bosé. In the following decade, Bosé's popularity continued undiminished; he released four more studio albums and two live albums. In 2000 he recorded Girados, a collaborative double live album with Ana Torroja. 2002's Sereno won him a Latin Grammy for Best Male Pop Performance, while 2005's Velvetina saw him stepping outside the box to experiment with electronic dance-pop (even the cover was a clear homage to Kraftwerk). In 2007, celebrating 30 years in the business, he made the album Papito, where numerous stars of Latin music -- including huge names like Juanes, Shakira, Ricky Martin and Laura Pausini -- joined him in re-recording duet versions of some of his biggest hits. A younger listenership was turned on to his music by the single \"Como un Lobo,\" featuring his niece Bimba Bosé, herself a successful singer and model. He then took the album on the road, resulting in the live effort Papitour. His 18th studio album, Cardio, was issued in 2010. Produced by Bosé with Nicolas Sorin, it spent all of the spring and summer on the charts in Spain, as well as Mexico and Italy. Also in 2010, he was awarded honorary Colombian citizenship for his efforts toward peace in that country. Amo, released in 2014, became a Top Five success in Spain, and his MTV Unplugged set from 2016 hit number one in both Spain and Mexico. During his career as an international pop star, Bosé has portrayed a cross dresser in Pedro Almodovar's High Heels, worked with Andy Warhol on two videos, and witnessed the banning of his video \"No Encuentro un Momento Pa' Olvidar\" for its controversial sexual imagery. Defying the contemporary formula for pop success, his music has been described as a global fusion of many musical influences. At the center of this is all the passion and expression of a Latin artist, and Miguel Bosé has constantly incorporated more diverse musical elements than many of the genre's crossover pop stars. ~ Zac Johnson & John D.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

His congregation was racially integrated, and he was a much-lauded leader in the contemporary civil rights movement. Eventually, Jones moved his church, Peoples Temple, to northern California. He became involved in electoral politics, and soon was a prominent Bay Area leader.  In this riveting narrative, Jeff Guinn examines Jones's life, from his extramarital affairs, drug use, and fraudulent faith healing to the fraught decision to move almost a thousand of his followers to a settlement in the jungles of Guyana in South America. Guinn provides stunning new details of the events leading to the fatal day in November, 1978 when more than nine hundred people died--including almost three hundred infants and children--after being ordered to swallow a cyanide-laced drink.  Guinn examined thousands of pages of FBI files on the case, including material released during the course of his research. He traveled to Jones's Indiana hometown, where he spoke to people never previously interviewed, and uncovered fresh information from Jonestown survivors. He even visited the Jonestown site with the same pilot who flew there the day that Congressman Leo Ryan was murdered on Jones's orders. The Road to Jonestown is the definitive book about Jim Jones and the events that led to the tragedy at Jonestown.  (Simon & Schuster)","locationName":"","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/jeff-guinn-road-jonestown","date":"April 24","type":"Miscellaneous"},{"name":"Allergies: The Flower Show","summary":"ALLERGIES: THE FLOWER SHOW - APRIL 8TH – MAY 4TH AT SUGARMYNT GALLERY IN SOUTH PASADENA.This is our flower show with a twist, the twist being none of the flowers are real.

His songs have been recorded by our finest voices including Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Glen Campbell, and Art Garfunkel. Webb is the only artist to have received GRAMMY Awards for music, lyrics and orchestration and was the youngest man ever inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In his new book, The Cake and The Rain: A Memoir, Webb delivers a snapshot of his life from 1955 to 1970, from simple farm in Oklahoma to fast and fantastical Los Angeles, from the crucible of his family to the top of his longed-for profession. The Cake and The Rain is a surprising and unusual book: Webb's talent as a writer and storyteller is here on every page. His book is rich with a sense of time and place, and with the voices of characters, vanished and living, famous and not, but all intimately involved with him in his youth, when life seemed nothing more than a party and Webb the eternal guest of honor. Webb's first book, Tunesmith: The Art of Songwriting is considered a bible among musicians. The GRAMMY Museum welcomes Jimmy Webb for a discussion on his extraordinary career and new memoir The Cake and The Rain. The evening will be hosted by GRAMMY Foundation Vice President Scott Goldman and will be followed by an intimate performance. A book signing will be held after the program.","locationName":"GRAMMY Museum","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/evening-jimmy-webb","date":"April 26","address":"A245, 800 West Olympic Boulevard Los Angeles CA","type":"Music"},{"name":"Allergies: The Flower Show","summary":"ALLERGIES: THE FLOWER SHOW - APRIL 8TH – MAY 4TH AT SUGARMYNT GALLERY IN SOUTH PASADENA.This is our flower show with a twist, the twist being none of the flowers are real.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

Decades later, Landau rediscovered his Kodachromes , which ended up being the most extensive collection of photographs to document this remarkable Sunset Strip phenomenon. Inspired, he interviewed the artists, record producers, and designers who brought the billboards to life, lending fresh insight to the culture of the day.  It’s all chronicled in Landau’s book Rock ‘N’ Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip (Angel City Press). In conjunction with a public art exhibit consisting of 10 large format versions of Robert Landau's photos; this talk is presented by the City of West Hollywood through Weho Arts and WeHo Reads (www.weho.org/arts) as part of  'There's Something Happening Here...' a year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the counterculture era on the Sunset Strip.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21. The show runs Wednesdays through Sundays through May 7, 2017.","locationName":"Rubicon Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/sylvia-0","date":"April 19-May 7","address":"1006 E.

As well as high comedy and romance, The Magic Flute possesses a serious ethical side, and we hear both these qualities in its remarkable overture. Composed in 1773, when Mozart was only 17 years old, the evening continues with the composer’s Symphony #25, with wide-leap melodic lines and engaging syncopation. The second half of the concert features Mozart’s iconic Requiem in D Minor. The Requiem was composed in 1791, but remained unfinished at the time of Mozart’s death. Stories abound as factiously portrayed in the 1984 film, Amadeus, concerning who actually completed it, though most scholars attribute its final iteration to Suessmayer in 1792. Though some of the facts put forth in that film may not be entirely accurate, the genius of Mozart’s Requiem is irrefutable. The choral component of the work will be fulfilled by the Symphony’s artistic partner, Long Beach Camerata Singers, for which Istad serves as Artistic Director.","locationName":"Terrace Theater","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/long-beach-symphony-evening-mozart","date":"April 29","address":"300 E.

The Hutchins Consort will be performing music from some of these composers who contributed to enrich the world music scene, like Bartok, Schoenberg, Stravinsky or Zeisl.  The Hutchins Consort plays on the eight scaled violins designed and built by luthier Dr. Carleen Hutchins, whose research into the acoustic properties of string instruments resulted in an innovative process called free-plate tuning; a precise method of refining the top and back plates of a violin before it is assembled to bring it to peak acoustic performance. The fruits of her labor are the eight Hutchins violins, ranging in size from the 18.5-inch treble to the 7.2-foot contrabass. Like all violins, these instruments capture the emotional element of the music. But they have the additional advantage of being crafted as a complete set with the same harmonic DNA  giving them the ability to produce a unique array of sounds that add a new dimension to the works they perform.","locationName":"St. Augustine by-the-Sea","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/hutchins-consort-immigrants","date":"April 29","address":"1227 Fourth Street, Santa Monica  CA 90401","type":"Music"},{"name":"Elevator","summary":"Michael Leoni’s celebrated play ELEVATOR returns to Los Angeles for a special limited engagement at The Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood from March 23 – April 30, 2017.

Gurney (Love Letters, The Dining Room). Considered a comic masterpiece, this hilarious and heartwarming comedy follows a love triangle that forms between empty-nesters Greg and Kate (Kevin Symons and Stasha Surdyke) and an adorable mutt named Sylvia (Ashley Fox Linton). Greg discovers Sylvia on a visit to Central Park and brings her home without asking for Kate’s consent, causing friction in their marriage. Greg and Kate confer with friends, strangers and therapists, and ultimately Greg must make a difficult choice. Ovation Award-winning director Stephanie Coltrin has set the play in 2017 in multiple locations in New York City which will be effected by an automated turntable and projections designed by Mike Billings. SYLVIA speaks to our desire for unconditional love and our need to connect on a deeper level in an increasingly fast-paced and complicated world. The play offers insights into the nature of love, marriage, jealousy, and, of course, dogs. SYLVIA opens in Ventura on Saturday, April 22 at 7 p.m., followed by a post-show party with cast, crew and local VIPs. Low-priced previews are April 19-21.

With a history of twisted secrets, alcohol, and mental health issues, none of them are even speaking except when they’re suing each other. Following the family’s innuendos that his uncle may actually be his father, the playwright seeks to find the one person who can share the truth. Dan O’Brien’s memoir is a highly poetic, spare, theatrical journey. Two virtuoso actors embody the whole family in an exploration of the deep need we all have to reconcile the family we want with the one we have.","locationName":"Boston Court Performing Arts Center","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/house-scarsdale-memoir-stage","date":"April 27-June 4","address":"70 N Mentor Ave Pasadena CA 91106","type":"Arts & Theater"},{"name":"Jackalope Pasadena","summary":"Jackalope Pasadena returns to Central Park for our Spring 2017 fair, coming up on April 29th & 30th.
