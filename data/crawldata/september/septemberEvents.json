No longer considered the Worst Film of All Time (thanks largely to Mystery Science Theater 3000 reruns), it now looks more like what it truly is — a labor of love made by a visionary director bereft of talent. Edward D. Wood Jr.'s legendary 1959 whatsit will screen at Cinefamily as part of its Friday Night Frights series.

One of the purest of prison-escape films, it seethes with the energy of a director never content to settle for mere realism. Much more than a taut exercise in suspense, it's a close study of men under pressure and of the primal need for freedom. Its suffocating atmosphere and laserlike focus make The Shawshank Redemption look like a cake walk. This rerelease is the result of a new 4K transfer by Rialto Pictures.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 1","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 2","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 2","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 2","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 2","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

The film is preceded by a tribute to Keaton friend and 102-year-old actor-director Norman Lloyd (Hitchcock’s Saboteur and Spellbound, St. Elsewhere), who’ll receive the Cinecon Legacy Award by Judd Apatow and Howie Mandel.","locationName":"Egyptian Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cinecon-53-classic-film-festival-8541853","date":"September 3","type":"Film","filterType":"Film & TV","address":"6712 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90028 323-466-3456","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/egyptian-theatre-2183946"},{"name":"\"Hollywood in Havana: Five Decades of Cuban Posters...","summary":"By Siran Babayan As part of The Getty’s Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, the Pasadena Museum of California Art’s new exhibit, Hollywood in Havana: Five Decades of Posters Promoting U.S. Films, displays American film posters made in Cuba between 1960 and 2009.

The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 3","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

The Entire Universe haven’t released any music yet but, judging from Ramuno’s bandmates — Evan Snyder of Seattle psych-rockers Night Beats and Eric Lodwick of fuzzy New York power-pop trio Shining Mirrors — we probably can expect a trippy, riff-heavy extension of his previous work. They begin a Monday-night September residency at Zebulon with comedian and vocal-loop maestro Reggie Watts, local glam-rockers Fatal Jamz and the spacey bedroom pop of Oxnard native Cola Boyy. It all begins with a DJ set by some of Zebulon’s coolest Frogtown neighbors, psychedelic synth-rock duo Gardens and Villa.","locationName":"Zebulon","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-entire-universe-reggie-watts-fatal-jamz-cola-boyy-8565536","date":"September 4","type":"Alternative Psychedelic Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"2478 Fletcher Dr. Los Angeles, CA 90039 323-662-0966","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/zebulon-8215798"},{"name":"La Brea Tar Pits","summary":"The world's most famous ice age excavation site also includes the adjoining Page Museum.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

You go in, guided by an attendant, to an empty chair in the middle of the theater. The chairs around it have been moved away. The film, which runs just under 50 minutes, is black, white and red, the red matching the exit signs that line the otherwise dark theater. It pays romantic, heavy homage to lots of different things — Voodoo, punk, existential crises, cultural rituals and Care Bears — though mostly it’s about itself. A priestess does a ritual, cursing rolls of film that will later be used to shoot footage we’re watching. Actress Charlotte Rampling appears at one point wearing a Grumpy Bear suit, though the suit hangs loosely and she appears onstage monologuing over-seriously about the nature of reality, so you might not make the cartoon connection right away.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/loris-greaud-sculpt-7292258","date":"September 4","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Jonas Wood: Still Life With Two Owls","summary":"Longtime L.A. artist Jonas Wood painted Still Life With Two Owls in 2014.

Two pots on the darker side are shaped and painted to look like blinged-out, red-cheeked owls. In time for the holidays, Wood scaled up this painting and applied a slightly altered, vinyl version of it to the street-facing side of MOCA’s Grand Avenue building.

Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"September 5","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

With a deft, light touch, Chin goes from speedy, Tatum-esque runs up and down the keyboard (amazing independence of both hands) on a variety of boppy standards to bruisingly intimate reflections that poke at the harmonic, melodic and contrapuntal possibilities of his chosen repertoire. Working within the confines of a trad jazz trio (acoustic piano, stand-up bass and drums) seems to open wide vistas for the Juilliard-trained, Kenny Barron–mentored Chin. He’s full of surprises in his seemingly organic ability to veer from the bluesy roots of the jazz-canon playbook to full-on hypermodern abstraction, transcending the dusty clichés of both.","locationName":"Blue Whale","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-john-chin-trio-8565529","date":"September 5","type":"Jazz Piano","filterType":"Music","address":"123 Astronaut E.S.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible.

Like Persian miniatures, Bustamante’s paintings are elaborate and enticing. Flowers from Mars combines carefully painted human-interpreted flora with otherworldly environments. The environments are constructed with washes of gouache and acrylic paint to create ethereal and atmospheric settings, where microscopic gardens float and flourish. Laurel finds abstraction to be more poetic in expressing nature than realism. Researching botanical motifs found in history is an important part of her process. By combining and contrasting highly rendered flora within atmospheric and abstract settings, she is exploring the schism in the human brain between our delight in nature and our global inability to maintain it. Each painting develops organically without a predetermined plan. The contrast between vaporous washes and tiny brushwork is extreme and requires a slow, contemplative process.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 6","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

Like Persian miniatures, Bustamante’s paintings are elaborate and enticing. Flowers from Mars combines carefully painted human-interpreted flora with otherworldly environments. The environments are constructed with washes of gouache and acrylic paint to create ethereal and atmospheric settings, where microscopic gardens float and flourish. Laurel finds abstraction to be more poetic in expressing nature than realism. Researching botanical motifs found in history is an important part of her process. By combining and contrasting highly rendered flora within atmospheric and abstract settings, she is exploring the schism in the human brain between our delight in nature and our global inability to maintain it. Each painting develops organically without a predetermined plan. The contrast between vaporous washes and tiny brushwork is extreme and requires a slow, contemplative process. Laurel Bustamante received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Southern Oregon University, Summa Cum Laude. In 2013, she was the finalist for the Portland Art Museum Contemporary Northwest Art Awards, in Portland Oregon. She was awarded the Crater Lake National Park Artist Residency in 2001 and the Artist on Location Project in Antilles, Netherlands in 2000.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/flowers-from-mars-new-paintings-by-laurel-bustamante-7089718","date":"September 6","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lora-schlesinger-gallery-2183922"},{"name":"LA Hootenanny LIVE at Villains Tavern","summary":"Promotional Event Description LA Hootenanny LIVE at Villains Tavern Come shake booty and scoot boots with their huge band and entourage of dancers!

It’s wise not to underestimate the teenage Night and her similarly youthful bandmates Genessa Gariano (guitar), Sage Chavis (bass) and Maxx Morando (drums). Although The Regrettes’ punk-pop songs are often structured with the harmonies and hooks of ’60s girl-group anthems, they’re also underlined with smart, defiant lyrics.

She also reveals a more personal side on such poppy, romantic tunes as “Hey Now.” The Paranoyds are another local punk-pop quartet who occasionally venture into harder and more psychedelic territory on hazy asides like “Sleep Paralysis.”","locationName":"The Dr. Martens Store","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-regrettes-the-paranoyds-8539721","date":"September 7","type":"Alternative Garage Rock Pop Punk Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"12196 Ventura Blvd. Studio City, CA 91604 818-358-4271","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-dr-martens-store-8539714"},{"name":"Stiff Little Fingers","summary":"By Paul Rogers Formed in Northern Ireland during the late-’70s height of the community-dividing “Troubles,” Stiff Little Fingers were overtly channeling that conflict’s grim day-to-day reality long before U2, who are from the neighboring, much less affected Republic of Ireland, were making more aloof references. Among the most eloquent of punk rock’s knee-jerk reactions, the Fingers have always displayed a raw musicality rare in their genre, with instinctively insistent choruses, bobbin’ ’n’ weavin’ bass lines and grittily romantic lyrics written amid masked gunmen and frequent bombings (SLF’s 1979 debut, Inflammable Material, opens with “Suspect Device” and “State of Emergency”). With constant frontman Jake Burns and original bassist Ali McMordie still aboard, the 40th-anniversary edition of SLF is a little tamer and more wistful than the classic incarnation, but the taut tunefulness endures.","locationName":"El Rey Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stiff-little-fingers-8453555","date":"September 7","type":"Punk Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"5515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-936-6400","price":"$25","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/el-rey-theatre-2184728"},{"name":"Jay Dee Maness, Cody Bryant, Skip Edwards, Ronnie Mack","summary":"By Jonny Whiteside The loss of Merle Haggard and Red Simpson this year seemed to sound a final death knell for legitimate California country, but anytime Jay Dee Maness takes the bandstand, all such dismay is erased. The legendary pedal steel guitarist, who replaced Tom Brumley in Buck Owens’ Buckaroos circa ’69, is an incomparable musician with impeccable taste and an impressive trove of stellar credits. Maness’ warm, expressive style — always complementary, never overplayed — made him an in-demand sideman, and he has recorded with everyone from Gram Parsons and The Byrds to Charlie Rich and Waylon Jennings. Joined at this weekly sit-down jam by the likes of formidable guitar slingers Carmine Sardo and Cody Bryant, pianist Skip Edwards and local hero Ronnie Mack, Maness is in the ideal setting, and the results are invariably stunning.","locationName":"Cody's Viva Cantina","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/jay-dee-maness-cody-bryant-skip-edwards-ronnie-mack-6741578","date":"September 7","type":"Country Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"900 Riverside Dr. Burbank, CA 91506 818-848-8810","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/codys-viva-cantina-2183790"},{"name":"Reflecting Culture: The Francis E.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible. You get the attention of a personal trainer, have fun, get results, make lasting friends and bond with your little one, for a fraction of the cost. d on KTLA, ABC 7, The Doctors and many publications and sites.

Like Persian miniatures, Bustamante’s paintings are elaborate and enticing. Flowers from Mars combines carefully painted human-interpreted flora with otherworldly environments. The environments are constructed with washes of gouache and acrylic paint to create ethereal and atmospheric settings, where microscopic gardens float and flourish. Laurel finds abstraction to be more poetic in expressing nature than realism. Researching botanical motifs found in history is an important part of her process. By combining and contrasting highly rendered flora within atmospheric and abstract settings, she is exploring the schism in the human brain between our delight in nature and our global inability to maintain it. Each painting develops organically without a predetermined plan. The contrast between vaporous washes and tiny brushwork is extreme and requires a slow, contemplative process. Laurel Bustamante received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Southern Oregon University, Summa Cum Laude. In 2013, she was the finalist for the Portland Art Museum Contemporary Northwest Art Awards, in Portland Oregon. She was awarded the Crater Lake National Park Artist Residency in 2001 and the Artist on Location Project in Antilles, Netherlands in 2000.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/flowers-from-mars-new-paintings-by-laurel-bustamante-7089718","date":"September 7","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lora-schlesinger-gallery-2183922"},{"name":"LA Hootenanny LIVE at Villains Tavern","summary":"Promotional Event Description LA Hootenanny LIVE at Villains Tavern Come shake booty and scoot boots with their huge band and entourage of dancers!

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 8","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 8","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 8","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 8","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

Andreas Bauer, Christoph Meier, Robert Schwarz and Lukas Stopczynski, all current artists-in-residence at the MAK Center for art and architecture, have built a poor man’s version of the Loos Bar in Mid-Wilshire. Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"September 8","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Two pots on the darker side are shaped and painted to look like blinged-out, red-cheeked owls.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 9","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 10","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 10","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"ASSSSCAT","summary":"By Zachary Pincus-Roth UCB's flagship improv night featuring a rotating cast of UCB greats, such as Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Matt Walsh, Sean Conroy, Lauren Lapkus, Joe Wengert and Zach Woods, plus special guest improvisers and monologist.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 11","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

But now I'm booking people who are blowing up in Canada or blowing up in Australia, and it opens up the range,\" says Coccoli, whose new show, Fringe, has been dubbed \"comedy with bangs.\" As with every Fringe show, comedians are encouraged to use wigs and props, while Public House foots the bill for the audience's pizza and beer. A sports bar might be an unlikely place for fringe comedy, but it's all part of the concept, Coccoli says. \"I want it to feel like if Andy Warhol had a weird comedy club in his Factory inside a very bro'd-out bar.\" Public House, 1739 N.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 11","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Cool Blue","summary":"","locationName":"Las Hadas","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cool-blue-4290940","date":"September 11","type":"Music Jazz","filterType":"Music","address":"9048 Balboa Blvd. Northridge, CA 91325 818-892-7271","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/las-hadas-2184825"},{"name":"The Eric Ekstrand Trio","summary":"","locationName":"Colombo's Italian Steakhouse & Jazz Club","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-eric-ekstrand-trio-4290789","date":"September 11","type":"Music Jazz Piano","filterType":"Music","address":"1833 Colorado Blvd. Eagle Rock, CA 90041 323-254-9138","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/colombos-italian-steakhouse-and-jazz-club-2182912"},{"name":"La Brea Tar Pits","summary":"The world's most famous ice age excavation site also includes the adjoining Page Museum.

Art Contest: LA VICTORIA® Brand Gives Back to Local...","summary":"To commemorate its 100th anniversary this year, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand, the iconic, Southern California-based maker of salsas, taco sauces, enchilada sauces and chiles, today announced an art contest in Los Angeles to help bring to life its embodiment of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” From now until May 10, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand invite Los Angeles artists to submit original artwork to be considered for an opportunity to participate in the brand’s commemorative anniversary celebration on June 1. Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities. For Official Rules or to enter the art contest, visit http://lavictoria.com/100Years during the entry period and submit five works of art and other requested materials.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible. You get the attention of a personal trainer, have fun, get results, make lasting friends and bond with your little one, for a fraction of the cost. d on KTLA, ABC 7, The Doctors and many publications and sites.

Culled from Culver City-based Center for the Study of Political Graphic’s collection, the approximately 40 silkscreens of such movies as The Godfather, The Shining, Singin’ in the Rain, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? and Silence of the Lambs – as well as a few Cuban movies – were created following the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and illustrate how, unlike Hollywood advertising, Cuban artists employed more minimal techniques inspired by Art Nouveau, abstract and Pop art styles.","locationName":"Pasadena Museum of California Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/hollywood-in-havana-five-decades-of-cuban-posters-promoting-us-films-8521991","date":"September 13","type":"Art Galleries Photography","filterType":"Art","address":"490 E.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 13","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 13","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 13","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"King Chris & the Groove Thang","summary":"","locationName":"Backstage Bar & Grill","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/king-chris-and-the-groove-thang-4290655","date":"September 13","type":"Music Rock Soul","filterType":"Music","address":"10400 Culver Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-3892","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/backstage-bar-and-grill-2187882"},{"name":"Noah's Ark at the Skirball","summary":"An exhibit aimed at families that includes a floor-to-ceiling wooden ark and animal sculptures.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/noahs-ark-at-the-skirball-4291271","date":"September 13","type":"Museums","filterType":"Museum","address":"2701 N.

He’s the guy that your dad would always harp on about: “He can really play and doesn’t rely on tricks — not like these guys today.” For many he represents dad-rock: no edge, no risks, no fun. But that’s not really fair, or even representative of old Slowhand’s career. This guy was in Cream and The Yardbirds — two of the wildest blues-rock bands of all time. As a result of those two groups and his solo career, he’s the only three-time inductee in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And “Layla,” his hit with Derek and the Dominos, remains a banger.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"September 13","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 14","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

But whereas Hall & Oates had their roots in Philly soul, England’s Tears for Fears almost epitomized synth-y new wave before broadening their palette into soulful psychedelia.

What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 15","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 16","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 17","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week. Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 17","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"September 17","type":"Comedy","filterType":"Comedy","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/trepany-house-at-the-steve-allen-theater-2186233"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 17","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"ASSSSCAT","summary":"By Zachary Pincus-Roth UCB's flagship improv night featuring a rotating cast of UCB greats, such as Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Matt Walsh, Sean Conroy, Lauren Lapkus, Joe Wengert and Zach Woods, plus special guest improvisers and monologist.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities.

Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 19","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 19","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Victory Lap","summary":"By Jennifer Swann Victory Lap is a variety show, emphasis on the variety: There’s a traditional house band and stand-up comedians (Megan Koester, Brendon Small, Dan St. Germain) between sets, but then there are the weirder things: puppet surgery, tap dancing, busking. Even stranger is what takes place offstage: slow dancing, usually. That’s because at Victory Lap, there’s no separation between performers and audience members, and the latter can purchase raffle tickets for a chance to take the stage and spin a giant wheel that will lead to either humiliation or victory — often, one is the result of the other, and there are plenty of cool prizes as consolation. Tonight’s Halloween-themed shindig is hosted by Dracula (who looks a lot like Victory Lap co-host Seth W. Owen) and the wheel features more frightening challenges than usual. “If it lands on a séance, we’ll have a séance onstage,” producer Sharon Eisman says. “We’re a little nuts.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible. You get the attention of a personal trainer, have fun, get results, make lasting friends and bond with your little one, for a fraction of the cost. d on KTLA, ABC 7, The Doctors and many publications and sites.

Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"September 19","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lora-schlesinger-gallery-2183922"},{"name":"FILM FESTIVAL LOS ANGELES","summary":"ARRIVING APRIL 27TH - 30TH 2017 Four days of screenings, parties and artist programs that celebrate independent film making in the heart of Santa Monica.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 20","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"September 20","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Two pots on the darker side are shaped and painted to look like blinged-out, red-cheeked owls.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 21","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 21","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

You may recognize \"Convoy's\" trio of performers as the ingeniously helpful losers Swift, Blodget and Gunt from FX's short-lived Terriers.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 21","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Jay Dee Maness, Cody Bryant, Skip Edwards, Ronnie Mack","summary":"By Jonny Whiteside The loss of Merle Haggard and Red Simpson this year seemed to sound a final death knell for legitimate California country, but anytime Jay Dee Maness takes the bandstand, all such dismay is erased.

The film, which runs just under 50 minutes, is black, white and red, the red matching the exit signs that line the otherwise dark theater. It pays romantic, heavy homage to lots of different things — Voodoo, punk, existential crises, cultural rituals and Care Bears — though mostly it’s about itself. A priestess does a ritual, cursing rolls of film that will later be used to shoot footage we’re watching.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 22","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"September 22","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 23","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 23","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 23","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 23","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 24","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"September 24","type":"Comedy","filterType":"Comedy","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/trepany-house-at-the-steve-allen-theater-2186233"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

But now I'm booking people who are blowing up in Canada or blowing up in Australia, and it opens up the range,\" says Coccoli, whose new show, Fringe, has been dubbed \"comedy with bangs.\" As with every Fringe show, comedians are encouraged to use wigs and props, while Public House foots the bill for the audience's pizza and beer. A sports bar might be an unlikely place for fringe comedy, but it's all part of the concept, Coccoli says. \"I want it to feel like if Andy Warhol had a weird comedy club in his Factory inside a very bro'd-out bar.\" Public House, 1739 N.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 25","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

The film, which runs just under 50 minutes, is black, white and red, the red matching the exit signs that line the otherwise dark theater.

Actress Charlotte Rampling appears at one point wearing a Grumpy Bear suit, though the suit hangs loosely and she appears onstage monologuing over-seriously about the nature of reality, so you might not make the cartoon connection right away.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/loris-greaud-sculpt-7292258","date":"September 25","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Jonas Wood: Still Life With Two Owls","summary":"Longtime L.A. artist Jonas Wood painted Still Life With Two Owls in 2014. In his characteristically flat, sunny way, he depicts shelves full of plants and pots. Some of the pots are the plain old terracotta kind you’d find at Home Depot. Other colorful, patterned ones look handmade. Sky-blue light shines through the shelves on the right, while those on the left could be in some dimly lit closet. Two pots on the darker side are shaped and painted to look like blinged-out, red-cheeked owls. In time for the holidays, Wood scaled up this painting and applied a slightly altered, vinyl version of it to the street-facing side of MOCA’s Grand Avenue building. So now the outside of the museum depicts a decorative indoor garden.","locationName":"MOCA Grand Avenue","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/jonas-wood-still-life-with-two-owls-7778491","date":"September 25","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"250 S.

Art Contest: LA VICTORIA® Brand Gives Back to Local...","summary":"To commemorate its 100th anniversary this year, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand, the iconic, Southern California-based maker of salsas, taco sauces, enchilada sauces and chiles, today announced an art contest in Los Angeles to help bring to life its embodiment of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” From now until May 10, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand invite Los Angeles artists to submit original artwork to be considered for an opportunity to participate in the brand’s commemorative anniversary celebration on June 1. Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities. For Official Rules or to enter the art contest, visit http://lavictoria.com/100Years during the entry period and submit five works of art and other requested materials.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible.

You go in, guided by an attendant, to an empty chair in the middle of the theater. The chairs around it have been moved away. The film, which runs just under 50 minutes, is black, white and red, the red matching the exit signs that line the otherwise dark theater. It pays romantic, heavy homage to lots of different things — Voodoo, punk, existential crises, cultural rituals and Care Bears — though mostly it’s about itself. A priestess does a ritual, cursing rolls of film that will later be used to shoot footage we’re watching. Actress Charlotte Rampling appears at one point wearing a Grumpy Bear suit, though the suit hangs loosely and she appears onstage monologuing over-seriously about the nature of reality, so you might not make the cartoon connection right away.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/loris-greaud-sculpt-7292258","date":"September 26","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Jonas Wood: Still Life With Two Owls","summary":"Longtime L.A. artist Jonas Wood painted Still Life With Two Owls in 2014.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 27","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 27","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 27","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

Art Contest: LA VICTORIA® Brand Gives Back to Local...","summary":"To commemorate its 100th anniversary this year, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand, the iconic, Southern California-based maker of salsas, taco sauces, enchilada sauces and chiles, today announced an art contest in Los Angeles to help bring to life its embodiment of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” From now until May 10, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand invite Los Angeles artists to submit original artwork to be considered for an opportunity to participate in the brand’s commemorative anniversary celebration on June 1. Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"September 27","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"September 27","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lora-schlesinger-gallery-2183922"},{"name":"FILM FESTIVAL LOS ANGELES","summary":"ARRIVING APRIL 27TH - 30TH 2017 Four days of screenings, parties and artist programs that celebrate independent film making in the heart of Santa Monica.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 28","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Jay Dee Maness, Cody Bryant, Skip Edwards, Ronnie Mack","summary":"By Jonny Whiteside The loss of Merle Haggard and Red Simpson this year seemed to sound a final death knell for legitimate California country, but anytime Jay Dee Maness takes the bandstand, all such dismay is erased. The legendary pedal steel guitarist, who replaced Tom Brumley in Buck Owens’ Buckaroos circa ’69, is an incomparable musician with impeccable taste and an impressive trove of stellar credits. Maness’ warm, expressive style — always complementary, never overplayed — made him an in-demand sideman, and he has recorded with everyone from Gram Parsons and The Byrds to Charlie Rich and Waylon Jennings. Joined at this weekly sit-down jam by the likes of formidable guitar slingers Carmine Sardo and Cody Bryant, pianist Skip Edwards and local hero Ronnie Mack, Maness is in the ideal setting, and the results are invariably stunning.","locationName":"Cody's Viva Cantina","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/jay-dee-maness-cody-bryant-skip-edwards-ronnie-mack-6741578","date":"September 28","type":"Country Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"900 Riverside Dr. Burbank, CA 91506 818-848-8810","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/codys-viva-cantina-2183790"},{"name":"La Brea Tar Pits","summary":"The world's most famous ice age excavation site also includes the adjoining Page Museum.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible. You get the attention of a personal trainer, have fun, get results, make lasting friends and bond with your little one, for a fraction of the cost. d on KTLA, ABC 7, The Doctors and many publications and sites.

His ongoing Friday night shows at Largo are a great chance to experience the encyclopedic-brained Brion in his purest form. His one-man-band performances typically find him working without a set list, using audience suggestions as a jumping-off point for covers of pop oldies familiar, obscure and often hilariously “wrong,” along with his own supremely crafted original tunes, all done on piano, guitar, drums and loops to genial and beautifully musical effect.","locationName":"Largo at the Coronet","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/jon-brion-7831195","date":"September 29","type":"Alternative Pop Rock Singer-Songwriter","filterType":"Music","address":"366 N.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 29","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 29","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass.

Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"September 30","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"September 30","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"September 30","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"September 30","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.
