As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"May 5","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

Trump’s election has been astutely described as the last great gasp of “regressive, patriarchal American whiteness,” and it’s hard to forget what that portends for reproductive rights while watching Hill’s affecting story about a 1960s teen mother forever scarred by the loss of her baby to adoption. Partly that’s because both the setting and the subject of Lord of the Underworld’s Home for Unwed Mothers, having its world premiere at Skylight Theatre, is what has been called the “baby scoop era.” That was the period between World War II and the sexual revolution when the uncontested, white patriarchal authority of the middle-class family routinely dealt with the era’s spike in teenage pregnancies through the forced separation and adoption of the child from its underage mother. The play is structured as a fancifully time-warped epistolary exchange between mother Dee (the searing Corryn Cummins, in a masterfully heartfelt performance) and daughter Corie (a forceful Michaela Slezak). Adrian Gonzalez and Amy Harmon are the play’s strikingly versatile, quick-change chorus, effortlessly emboding the parents, boyfriends and psychologists who inhabit both of the women’s worlds. Act 1 mostly deals with Dee’s insistently archetypal, circa-1964, middle-American brush with motherhood. Hill puts Dee through the paces of a postwar ideology that saw reproductive freedom as a bothersome impediment to social mobility. But anybody passingly familiar with Hollywood’s unwed-teen-mother melodramas of the 1950s and early ’60s — or who remembers Madonna’s politically suspect teen-pregnancy hit “Papa Don’t Preach” — may find themselves squirming over how the play develops pathos with what seems an unquestioned and one-sided embrace of the inviolable right of witless 16-year-olds to bear children. Act 2 does little to allay such misgivings. That’s when the narrative’s POV abruptly shifts to Corie, as she brings Dee up to date on what has happened since their one-and-only 10 minutes together outside a 1964 delivery room. The trauma of their parting has marked the daughter’s life as deeply as it has the mother’s. But a series of adoptions gone bad and an adolescence spent in children’s homes have left the now–25-year-old Corie an angry, cynical and stridently anti-maternal girl. When the two do finally meet, it is only to have Corie, who is now a singer in her new boyfriend’s death-metal band, repeatedly act out her anger with Dee in shockingly wounding ways. And while Hill manages to freshen up the genre’s expected reconciliation through a stroke of unexpected thematic symmetry, it is not before some of the plot’s seams begin to show. Most notable among those is how the two characters don’t seem to have evolved offstage. Cummins ably adds the emotional patina of 25 additional years to Dee, but drama is about relationships, and the script remains awkwardly silent on any husbands or children that might people her past. Hill likewise saddles Corie with a gap that for most women in their 20s is littered with ex-boyfriends. That said, director Tony Abatemarco gets winning performances from all the actors, while matching Hill’s self-consciously imagistic if sometimes overly literary language. The performances are complemented by designer Cindy Lin’s emblematic set of twisting roots and broken greenhouse windows in a staging suffused with as much nostalgia as knowing camp.","locationName":"Skylight Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/lord-of-the-underworlds-home-for-unwed-mothers-8127568","date":"May 5","type":"Theater","address":"1816 1/2 N.

There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"May 5","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"May 5","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"May 5","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

Andreas Bauer, Christoph Meier, Robert Schwarz and Lukas Stopczynski, all current artists-in-residence at the MAK Center for art and architecture, have built a poor man’s version of the Loos Bar in Mid-Wilshire. Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass.

These foods were placed in baskets decorated as “mini farm stands” in every classroom, making healthy snacks available throughout the day at no cost to students. Farm Stand 2.0 is a collaboration between National Health Foundation's (NHF) Health Academy at Thomas Jefferson Senior High and students of Woodbury University's School of Architecture. Students worked together to enhance and expand these mini farm stands to fit the school community’s needs. Through a series of workshops, Woodbury students provided opportunities for mentorship whereby Health Academy students were exposed to career paths in architecture and related fields.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"May 6","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

But her painting Blue Cut Fire (2017) has four slightly curvy vertical rods attached to it. The longest bright blue one pleasantly contrasts the oranges, browns and reds behind it, but the cords that connect one rod to another loop across the painting awkwardly, making it look like the back end of a some technical operation has been accidentally exposed.

Trump’s election has been astutely described as the last great gasp of “regressive, patriarchal American whiteness,” and it’s hard to forget what that portends for reproductive rights while watching Hill’s affecting story about a 1960s teen mother forever scarred by the loss of her baby to adoption. Partly that’s because both the setting and the subject of Lord of the Underworld’s Home for Unwed Mothers, having its world premiere at Skylight Theatre, is what has been called the “baby scoop era.” That was the period between World War II and the sexual revolution when the uncontested, white patriarchal authority of the middle-class family routinely dealt with the era’s spike in teenage pregnancies through the forced separation and adoption of the child from its underage mother. The play is structured as a fancifully time-warped epistolary exchange between mother Dee (the searing Corryn Cummins, in a masterfully heartfelt performance) and daughter Corie (a forceful Michaela Slezak). Adrian Gonzalez and Amy Harmon are the play’s strikingly versatile, quick-change chorus, effortlessly emboding the parents, boyfriends and psychologists who inhabit both of the women’s worlds. Act 1 mostly deals with Dee’s insistently archetypal, circa-1964, middle-American brush with motherhood. Hill puts Dee through the paces of a postwar ideology that saw reproductive freedom as a bothersome impediment to social mobility. But anybody passingly familiar with Hollywood’s unwed-teen-mother melodramas of the 1950s and early ’60s — or who remembers Madonna’s politically suspect teen-pregnancy hit “Papa Don’t Preach” — may find themselves squirming over how the play develops pathos with what seems an unquestioned and one-sided embrace of the inviolable right of witless 16-year-olds to bear children. Act 2 does little to allay such misgivings. That’s when the narrative’s POV abruptly shifts to Corie, as she brings Dee up to date on what has happened since their one-and-only 10 minutes together outside a 1964 delivery room. The trauma of their parting has marked the daughter’s life as deeply as it has the mother’s. But a series of adoptions gone bad and an adolescence spent in children’s homes have left the now–25-year-old Corie an angry, cynical and stridently anti-maternal girl. When the two do finally meet, it is only to have Corie, who is now a singer in her new boyfriend’s death-metal band, repeatedly act out her anger with Dee in shockingly wounding ways. And while Hill manages to freshen up the genre’s expected reconciliation through a stroke of unexpected thematic symmetry, it is not before some of the plot’s seams begin to show. Most notable among those is how the two characters don’t seem to have evolved offstage. Cummins ably adds the emotional patina of 25 additional years to Dee, but drama is about relationships, and the script remains awkwardly silent on any husbands or children that might people her past. Hill likewise saddles Corie with a gap that for most women in their 20s is littered with ex-boyfriends. That said, director Tony Abatemarco gets winning performances from all the actors, while matching Hill’s self-consciously imagistic if sometimes overly literary language. The performances are complemented by designer Cindy Lin’s emblematic set of twisting roots and broken greenhouse windows in a staging suffused with as much nostalgia as knowing camp.","locationName":"Skylight Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/lord-of-the-underworlds-home-for-unwed-mothers-8127568","date":"May 6","type":"Theater","address":"1816 1/2 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"May 7","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

Trump’s election has been astutely described as the last great gasp of “regressive, patriarchal American whiteness,” and it’s hard to forget what that portends for reproductive rights while watching Hill’s affecting story about a 1960s teen mother forever scarred by the loss of her baby to adoption. Partly that’s because both the setting and the subject of Lord of the Underworld’s Home for Unwed Mothers, having its world premiere at Skylight Theatre, is what has been called the “baby scoop era.” That was the period between World War II and the sexual revolution when the uncontested, white patriarchal authority of the middle-class family routinely dealt with the era’s spike in teenage pregnancies through the forced separation and adoption of the child from its underage mother. The play is structured as a fancifully time-warped epistolary exchange between mother Dee (the searing Corryn Cummins, in a masterfully heartfelt performance) and daughter Corie (a forceful Michaela Slezak). Adrian Gonzalez and Amy Harmon are the play’s strikingly versatile, quick-change chorus, effortlessly emboding the parents, boyfriends and psychologists who inhabit both of the women’s worlds. Act 1 mostly deals with Dee’s insistently archetypal, circa-1964, middle-American brush with motherhood. Hill puts Dee through the paces of a postwar ideology that saw reproductive freedom as a bothersome impediment to social mobility. But anybody passingly familiar with Hollywood’s unwed-teen-mother melodramas of the 1950s and early ’60s — or who remembers Madonna’s politically suspect teen-pregnancy hit “Papa Don’t Preach” — may find themselves squirming over how the play develops pathos with what seems an unquestioned and one-sided embrace of the inviolable right of witless 16-year-olds to bear children. Act 2 does little to allay such misgivings. That’s when the narrative’s POV abruptly shifts to Corie, as she brings Dee up to date on what has happened since their one-and-only 10 minutes together outside a 1964 delivery room. The trauma of their parting has marked the daughter’s life as deeply as it has the mother’s. But a series of adoptions gone bad and an adolescence spent in children’s homes have left the now–25-year-old Corie an angry, cynical and stridently anti-maternal girl. When the two do finally meet, it is only to have Corie, who is now a singer in her new boyfriend’s death-metal band, repeatedly act out her anger with Dee in shockingly wounding ways. And while Hill manages to freshen up the genre’s expected reconciliation through a stroke of unexpected thematic symmetry, it is not before some of the plot’s seams begin to show. Most notable among those is how the two characters don’t seem to have evolved offstage. Cummins ably adds the emotional patina of 25 additional years to Dee, but drama is about relationships, and the script remains awkwardly silent on any husbands or children that might people her past. Hill likewise saddles Corie with a gap that for most women in their 20s is littered with ex-boyfriends. That said, director Tony Abatemarco gets winning performances from all the actors, while matching Hill’s self-consciously imagistic if sometimes overly literary language. The performances are complemented by designer Cindy Lin’s emblematic set of twisting roots and broken greenhouse windows in a staging suffused with as much nostalgia as knowing camp.","locationName":"Skylight Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/lord-of-the-underworlds-home-for-unwed-mothers-8127568","date":"May 7","type":"Theater","address":"1816 1/2 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"May 7","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Derrick Adams: \"Network\"","summary":"By Catherine Wagley \"Colorful has taught them that they don't need a man,\" an actress says in artist Derrick Adams' short film On. \"They need Colorful.\" The actress holds a cardboard box with the word \"Colorful\" collaged onto it, and stands on a comically DIY set.

And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show.

The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots.

Admission is free, but please let us know if you plan to join us! 'Star Montana: I Dream of Los Angeles' When Star Montana was a student at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, she longed for California sunshine and dreamed of the light and the people of Los Angeles. A Boyle Heights native, she returned home periodically, trips during which she took a number of the photos on view in Beta Main. When Montana moved back to Los Angeles after graduation, the reality—the nightmare—of traumatic events with family and friends awaited her. Despite the circumstances, her dream of Los Angeles continues through her photography practice and is captured in the images in this exhibition. Many of the subjects in Montana’s photography are strangers she got to know when she approached them in East L.A. or South L.A., engaged them in conversation, and then asked to take their pictures. Some are friends and others she met via an open-call process to add to this body of work as part of her residency at The Main that preceded this exhibition. With honesty and sensitivity in equal measure, Montana endeavors to give visibility to those who are not often represented in art or art institutions. www.themainmuseum.org/programs/star-montana-i-dream-of-los-angeles 'Circle Chairs, Triangle Chairs' Sculptor Alice Könitz was commissioned to develop ideas for new types of museum seating that Beta Main—and soon, The Main—can use permanently in its galleries. Two prototypes were selected for production: Circle Chairs (2017) for the intimate environments they create both for looking and conversation, as well as their sculptural beauty, and Triangle Chairs (2017) for their many possible configurations and ease of use in the space. Könitz’s work, which is oriented in the physical object as well as the social space it creates, values model-making. In siting prototypes within the prototype of Beta Main, the museum has a unique opportunity to learn directly from visitors what may or may not be working in the process of making a museum and, more specifically, to better understand the experience of interacting with the seating in a gallery setting. We invite you to share your feedback by completing a brief survey available at the front desk in Beta Main. www.themainmuseum.org/programs/circle-chairs-triangle-chairs","locationName":"The Main Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/opening-reception-star-montana-with-alice-k-nitz-8154690","date":"May 7","type":"Art Museums Arts & Culture Free Events","address":"114 W 4th St Los Angeles, CA 90013 213-986-8500"},{"name":"Angels In America Part 1","summary":"","locationName":"Cal State Northridge, CSUN","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/angels-in-america-part-1-7220880","date":"May 7","type":"Theater","address":"18111 Nordhoff St. Northridge, CA 91330"},{"name":"Celebrate Israel Festival","summary":"On Sunday, May 7th the entire Israeli-American community will come together to celebrate Israel's 69th year of Independence and 50 Years to the reunification of Jerusalem at the Celebrate Israel Festival, the largest Jewish happening in the US!

The song starts out raw with little more than her intimately plaintive voice and a rubbery guitar riff against a starkly empty backdrop. Then the guitar starts snapping back wildly — sounding more like an arty PJ Harvey broadside than Feist’s early pop songs, such as “1234” — and the track fills up with chanted harmonies and foot-stomping percussion. The strangeness continues on “Century,” a song about loneliness and time that features whispery spoken-word from Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker, who divides the titular century into a billion individual seconds as Feist wails enigmatically above him.

Call them post-rock or post-punk, but it doesn’t really matter as the quartet craft darkly engrossing instrumental passages on their upcoming album, Obsidion. The bass-heavy tracks have curt, one-word titles, such as “Zenith” and “Entrada,” that belie their sprawling lengths. As with Barrows’ previous releases, the new record is a kind of concept album, in this case about a man who is “abducted from Earth and brought to Obsidion, a place where dimension is indefinable.” That vague storyline is merely an excuse to launch spacey, metallic forays into distortion and volume that are occasionally broken up with more melodic interludes.","locationName":"The Echoplex","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/barrows-qunq-facial-moaning-8152463","date":"May 8","type":"Alternative Experimental Instrumental Metal Psychedelic Rock","address":"1154 Glendale Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90026 213-413-8200"},{"name":"Mainardtown","summary":"By Siran Babayan Stand-up comic and writer Ever Mainard is a Second City Chicago graduate whose credits include Montreal’s Just for Laughs, Oddball Comedy & Curiosity Festival and RIOT L.A.

For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"May 8","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"May 8","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

As if this was not strange enough, he has the head of a chicken. Oh! Yes, people sometimes buy fried chicken in a bucket. But there is no fried chicken advertised anywhere. And so he stands there, out of place, out of time, carrying with him a certain past we can only imagine. The chicken man is not afraid of being ridiculous or obsolete. He stands tall. Behind him, a tiny theater invites guest with a defiantly huge sign: HIGHLAND THEATER Welcome to the rebellious soul of Highland Park where Plein Les Mirettes was conceived: a bold and unruly child, born to break the laws of chains, of the reassuringly familiar shops and restaurants. French-born artist Stephane Kardos found in Highland Park a treasure trove for the curious soul: an irreverent tribute to difference in a modern urban landscape often plagued by uniformity. Plein Les Mirettes is a French expression to describe astonishment, the type that leaves your eyes wanting more; as such it is perfect to encapsulate the eclectic energy of his art. Exuberant vintage cars from a glamorous era still exhibit bright colors in spite of their brown age spots; graffiti explode in chaotic colors and whimsical patterns; intricate Victorian houses defy modern architecture and the statue of a shark stands confidently in front of a messy collection of hand-painted signs. In front of our eyes comes alive a city that won’t apologize for its grit. With his art, Stephane Kardos pays tribute to its streets whose living history wake in us an eagerness to keep exploring.","locationName":"Civil Coffee","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/plein-les-mirettes-the-art-of-being-astonishing-7918156","date":"May 8","type":"Arts & Culture","address":"5629 N Figueroa St Los Angeles, Ca 90042 818-238-7262"},{"name":"Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness!","summary":"","locationName":"A Noise Within","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/eugene-oneills-ah-wilderness-7983076","date":"May 8","type":"Theater","address":"3352 E.

This 4-day workshop will include two days on location (weather permitting) and two days in the studio. Two days will be classroom work working from photographs creating value studies, color studies and creating a painting from the studies and reference material. The plein air painting days will take all the studio study into the field and we will paint from life capturing the natural light. Design and composition, perspective, color mixing, and palette organization will be addressed. After the workshop, artists will have the tools to create paintings that express their vision.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

They're enthusiastic if confusing. A girl-guy team peddles \"More for Less\" by saying it's just nice sometimes to have more, especially when it's for less. Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"May 9","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Brainstory, É Arenas, Chola Orange","summary":"By Chris Ziegler Brainstory have just released a long-awaited, self-titled mini-album — expertly produced by Chicano Batman’s Eduardo Arenas, whose formidable solo project opens this show — that refines and even redefines their soul-jazz-psychedelic sound.

These five sophisticated songs are the children of Arthur Lee, Shuggie Otis and Caetano Veloso, and second cousins of The Beach Boys — Brainstory’s “Water” flows easily into Surf’s Up — and even Ned Doheny, whose feather-light guitar and rhythm find a friend in Brainstory’s “Evil Cowboy.” Brainstory’s strategy is harmony, melody, agility and elasticity, and the results are smart stuff.

Offering a uniquely intimate take on the timeless struggle between the past and present, town and country, Francis’ writing is fueled by a deep understanding of characters and landscapes that are worlds apart—he also works as a lawyer based in Los Angeles and spends part of each year on his family farm in Australia. Discussing this psychological portrait of a divided family and their complicated roots, Francis is joined by master storyteller and fellow horse aficionado Jane Smiley, who has known Francis for years and calls Wedding Bush Road, “his best work yet.”","locationName":"Los Angeles Central Library, Mark Taper Auditorium","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/from-la-to-the-outback-two-novelists-7933977","date":"May 9","type":"Arts & Culture Community Events Literature","address":"630 W.

A symbol that is usually associated with this myth is the melting pot, which appears instructive on the surface until we begin to ask questions of it. Who is doing the melting, and what is the result? What is lost and what is gained in the melting? Is it language, culture, identity?

Then she traveled to the Swinomish Reservation in Washington, Coeur d'Alene Reservation in Idaho and Crow Reservation in Montana to meet and film those who responded. The drum circles and dancing depicted in her film, currently playing at Kayne Griffin Corcoran, were just for her camera, separate from any larger gatherings happening at the same time. Still, the footage has a documentary feel. The dancers' intricate costumes and long braids contrast with their relatively mundane surroundings (a parking garage, a shed in the background), but Friedman has done little to make her film seem portentous or to impose any narrative structure on its actors. She seems just to be acknowledging that there is power in these communal acts by indigenous Americans at this moment in history.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered.

Huynh’s current work probes questions of cultural perception and cultural authenticity through images of the Asian female body vis-à-vis plastic surgery. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. Huynh’s exhibition Pretty Hurts references Chinese foot-binding as one of the earliest forms of cosmetic surgery to contrast the antiquated canon of Asian feminine beauty (small feet, small eyes, a broad forehead, and small breasts) with the current trends of body image influenced by western canons that call for larger eyes, a delicate forehead, a taller nose, and larger breasts. She is interested in how contemporary plastic surgery on Asian women has not only obscured racial identity, but how it has also amplified the exoticism and Orientalist eroticism of Asian women. Therefore, the awkward synthesis of her projects of traditional and non-traditional, of east and west, unravel ideas of cultural representations and stereotypes to challenge how we consume and interpret ethnographic signifiers. Phung Huynh’s work investigates notions of cultural identity from a kaleidoscopic perspective, a continual shift of idiosyncratic translations. She explores how “outside” cultural ideas are imported, disassembled, and then reconstructed, within the American landscape. Dismantling cultural authenticity, she paints images of Chinese cherubs, lotus, carp and silk textile designs with a “pop” veneer that collide in a complicated composition of delight and horror to challenge the viewer with a western-leaning perspective, as well as the viewer with a nonwestern-leaning perspective. In an overwhelmingly diverse metropolis such as Los Angeles, images flood our social lens through mass reproduction and social media, taking on multiple [mis]interpretations. Such reflections have guided Huynh in re-stitching traditional Chinese iconography within the loosely woven fabric of American popular culture. There is a purposeful “Chinatown” aesthetic in Huynh’s paintings, alluding to kitsch souvenirs that tourists purchase and commoditization of eastern icons into tchotchkes. Phung Huynh has had solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside and the Sam Lee Gallery in LA. Her paintings and drawings have been exhibited nationally and internationally in countries such as Germany and Cambodia. She has also completed public art commissions for the Metro Orange Line, Metro Silver Line, and the Los Angeles Zoo. Huynh is Associate Professor of Art at Los Angeles Valley College. She completed undergraduate coursework at the University of Southern California, received her BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and her MFA from New York University.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/phung-huynh-pretty-hurts-8112892","date":"May 9","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"May 9","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Osvaldo Trujillo: \"Of Our Time\"","summary":"For his third solo exhibition at CB1 Gallery, we are pleased to present \"Of Our Time,\" Osvaldo Trujillo’s exhibition of painted and laser cut acrylic. This exhibition marks at once a new direction in Trujillo’s work and a return to a medium he has used in the past, integrating technology into his practice. As in his late 90’s through the early 2000’s work, the computer is a prime tool in his art-making process but the new work also uses digital processes along with the use of the laser cutter. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. The questions Trujillo asks in his new body of work include: What happens when machines can do most physical tasks better than any human could? Will we soon need to deal with questions like this in many areas of our lives? The issues and problems are extremely complex and the processes for resolving them are more than likely not peaceful. Reflecting this in the work for his exhibition, the pieces reference concepts on a macro scale, the topography of cities, the intricate connections of global computer networks, the complex structure of digital viruses. They reflect a new era, a new era of chaos. Mesmerized by the laser cutter when he first saw it at work, Trujillo knew it was something he wanted to explore and make art with. It quietly and smoothly moved across the work surface cutting and engraving with a speed and precision that the greatest human craftsman could never attain with a lifetime of practice. The artist realized that this device, along with other technologies like 3D printing, robotics etc. had reached a price point where they are now affordable to a mass consumer-market, represented the beginning of a new era of technological production that will rival the industrial revolution in its ability to transform our lives and this planet. While he was elated about this idea and the wonders we will create, the more he contemplated this the more he dreaded the monsters it would bring. Osvaldo Trujillo is a visual artist and professor, based in Los Angeles. In addition to past exhibitions at CB1 Gallery, his work has been shown at POST Gallery, Peggy Phelps Gallery, Art FrankFurt, Germany. He is currently represented by CB1 Gallery, Los Angeles, CA.

As if this was not strange enough, he has the head of a chicken. Oh! Yes, people sometimes buy fried chicken in a bucket. But there is no fried chicken advertised anywhere. And so he stands there, out of place, out of time, carrying with him a certain past we can only imagine. The chicken man is not afraid of being ridiculous or obsolete. He stands tall. Behind him, a tiny theater invites guest with a defiantly huge sign: HIGHLAND THEATER Welcome to the rebellious soul of Highland Park where Plein Les Mirettes was conceived: a bold and unruly child, born to break the laws of chains, of the reassuringly familiar shops and restaurants. French-born artist Stephane Kardos found in Highland Park a treasure trove for the curious soul: an irreverent tribute to difference in a modern urban landscape often plagued by uniformity. Plein Les Mirettes is a French expression to describe astonishment, the type that leaves your eyes wanting more; as such it is perfect to encapsulate the eclectic energy of his art. Exuberant vintage cars from a glamorous era still exhibit bright colors in spite of their brown age spots; graffiti explode in chaotic colors and whimsical patterns; intricate Victorian houses defy modern architecture and the statue of a shark stands confidently in front of a messy collection of hand-painted signs. In front of our eyes comes alive a city that won’t apologize for its grit.

The design collective Škart made these maps with refugees who are currently living in a refugee camp in Banja Kovilja?a, Serbia. Simple and immediately legible despite halting English, they tell dramatic, sometimes violent stories in short hand. Co-curated by Thomas Keenan and Sohrab Mohebbi, the show uses maps to explore and trace recent and ongoing migration between the Middle East, Africa and Europe.

For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence. All of these realities bleed together and coexist on the same intense, sensation-filled plane.","locationName":"Museum of Contemporary Art (The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-8097791","date":"May 10","type":"Art Galleries","address":"152 N.

A big, fake TV screen made of fabric squares and plastic hangs on the wall behind her. Several actors peddle cardboard boxes in On, pitching their products as if on a morning show or infomercial. They're enthusiastic if confusing. A girl-guy team peddles \"More for Less\" by saying it's just nice sometimes to have more, especially when it's for less. Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"May 10","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

Now, after canceling last year’s remaining tour dates, they’re back and picking up the pieces from the accident. Iero’s second solo album, Parachutes — released just two weeks after the crash — is a blend of alt-rock, punk and emo that shows his versatility as a songwriter and how much he’s matured since his days in MCR.

Tickets are $10.00 and can be purchased at www.TomClark.com. This independently financed show is the first hour-long recorded comedy special for Tom, who also serves as the Executive Producer. 20 years ago, Clark began his comedy career in his hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin with performers like Frank Caliendo (MAD TV) and Dan Harmon (NBC’s Community). In the late 90’s, Lewis Black told Clark he should move to Los Angeles, so he did! Shortly thereafter he won Comedy Central’s “Laugh Riots” competition and made his television debut on “The Late Late Show,” with Craig Kilborn. Clark has been featured on Comedy Central’s “Premium Blend,” played a murderer on TNT’s acclaimed show “The Closer,” and most recently can be seen playing a worrisome neighbor in 2015’s “Freaks of Nature,” featuring Vanessa Hudgens, Keegan Michael Key, Patton Oswalt and Denis Leary. In 2016, Clark accomplished a long time goal appearing on TBS’s “Conan.” Tom Clark’s special will blend quirky observational jokes with spontaneous improv, and some other unusual surprises.

The affected posturing of fashion models is combined with the purely instinctual behavior of animals in unpredictable, amusing and provocative ways. A smug-looking cat struts in designer jeans; a tiny bespectacled rabbit head disappears into the body of a rail-thin model wearing a luxurious coat; a muscular dog-headed tennis player gazes lovingly into the human-featured shaggy dog that lies cradled in his arms, against the setting of an ocean sunset. Like most of the idyllic nature scenes that serve as the backdrops of Hiltunen’s collages, it is turned sideways, adding to the beguilingly off-kilter charm. Direct and intense, the stunning reversals and inversions of these images reflect the care dedicated to their creation. Taken from fashion catalogs and travel magazines, Hiltunen invests substantial time arranging the components, laying them out on a table and considering the various options before achieving exactly the right effect.

The drum circles and dancing depicted in her film, currently playing at Kayne Griffin Corcoran, were just for her camera, separate from any larger gatherings happening at the same time. Still, the footage has a documentary feel. The dancers' intricate costumes and long braids contrast with their relatively mundane surroundings (a parking garage, a shed in the background), but Friedman has done little to make her film seem portentous or to impose any narrative structure on its actors. She seems just to be acknowledging that there is power in these communal acts by indigenous Americans at this moment in history.

Huynh’s current work probes questions of cultural perception and cultural authenticity through images of the Asian female body vis-à-vis plastic surgery. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. Huynh’s exhibition Pretty Hurts references Chinese foot-binding as one of the earliest forms of cosmetic surgery to contrast the antiquated canon of Asian feminine beauty (small feet, small eyes, a broad forehead, and small breasts) with the current trends of body image influenced by western canons that call for larger eyes, a delicate forehead, a taller nose, and larger breasts. She is interested in how contemporary plastic surgery on Asian women has not only obscured racial identity, but how it has also amplified the exoticism and Orientalist eroticism of Asian women. Therefore, the awkward synthesis of her projects of traditional and non-traditional, of east and west, unravel ideas of cultural representations and stereotypes to challenge how we consume and interpret ethnographic signifiers. Phung Huynh’s work investigates notions of cultural identity from a kaleidoscopic perspective, a continual shift of idiosyncratic translations. She explores how “outside” cultural ideas are imported, disassembled, and then reconstructed, within the American landscape. Dismantling cultural authenticity, she paints images of Chinese cherubs, lotus, carp and silk textile designs with a “pop” veneer that collide in a complicated composition of delight and horror to challenge the viewer with a western-leaning perspective, as well as the viewer with a nonwestern-leaning perspective. In an overwhelmingly diverse metropolis such as Los Angeles, images flood our social lens through mass reproduction and social media, taking on multiple [mis]interpretations. Such reflections have guided Huynh in re-stitching traditional Chinese iconography within the loosely woven fabric of American popular culture. There is a purposeful “Chinatown” aesthetic in Huynh’s paintings, alluding to kitsch souvenirs that tourists purchase and commoditization of eastern icons into tchotchkes. Phung Huynh has had solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside and the Sam Lee Gallery in LA. Her paintings and drawings have been exhibited nationally and internationally in countries such as Germany and Cambodia. She has also completed public art commissions for the Metro Orange Line, Metro Silver Line, and the Los Angeles Zoo. Huynh is Associate Professor of Art at Los Angeles Valley College. She completed undergraduate coursework at the University of Southern California, received her BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and her MFA from New York University.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/phung-huynh-pretty-hurts-8112892","date":"May 10","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

A symbolic rather than strategic victory, the battle was a source of pride and unity for the Mexican people, and the holiday still inspires such feelings in Mexicans around the world.

Relocated to L.A. after being based in Nashville, the duo have increased their already considerable magic powers with bassist Tommy Alexander and drummer Keith Crutchfield, a rhythm section who have added an exhilarating drive to the Valentines’ gauzy melodies.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

The all-female comedy show is bucking the trend of sex and dating jokes in exchange for sharp wit that transcends to all genders. The event’s mission continues to be twofold: raise funds for a good cause and put today’s best female comics at the forefront of the comedy landscape. In one of the most well established comedy clubs in the U.S., only 8% of headliners were women over 4 years. Underwire Comedy is on a Crusade to Change That. The time has come for a different type of female comedy. After a successful February premier show, Executive producer Stephany Burns is excited to announce the second comedy night for Underwire Comedy: Support the Funny! The event supports uniquely funny female comics while benefiting The Humane Society. The event will be held at 8:00pm on June 16, 2016 at the Westside Comedy Club in Santa Monica, CA. There appears to be a shortage of female stand-up comedians today, and the ones currently in the spotlight seem to believe their only source of approval is centered around their sexuality or dating life. Inspired by a debate about this lack of creativity, Underwire Comedy was born. The goal is to promote up and coming female stand-up comedians that do not need to resort to the same predictable sexcapades just to get a laugh. Underwire Comedy is hoping to help others discover the next Ellen, Whoopi or Tig. The night will be full of many hilarious ladies, with headliners Erin Foley (Comedy Central Presents) and Jodi Miller (America’s Got Talent). The all-female producing team of Underwire Comedy also believes in giving back to the community. A portion of the proceeds will benefit The Humane Society, the nations largest and most effective animal protection organization. Join us to raise women up in comedy and raise a little money for our furry friends too!

Trump’s election has been astutely described as the last great gasp of “regressive, patriarchal American whiteness,” and it’s hard to forget what that portends for reproductive rights while watching Hill’s affecting story about a 1960s teen mother forever scarred by the loss of her baby to adoption. Partly that’s because both the setting and the subject of Lord of the Underworld’s Home for Unwed Mothers, having its world premiere at Skylight Theatre, is what has been called the “baby scoop era.” That was the period between World War II and the sexual revolution when the uncontested, white patriarchal authority of the middle-class family routinely dealt with the era’s spike in teenage pregnancies through the forced separation and adoption of the child from its underage mother. The play is structured as a fancifully time-warped epistolary exchange between mother Dee (the searing Corryn Cummins, in a masterfully heartfelt performance) and daughter Corie (a forceful Michaela Slezak). Adrian Gonzalez and Amy Harmon are the play’s strikingly versatile, quick-change chorus, effortlessly emboding the parents, boyfriends and psychologists who inhabit both of the women’s worlds. Act 1 mostly deals with Dee’s insistently archetypal, circa-1964, middle-American brush with motherhood. Hill puts Dee through the paces of a postwar ideology that saw reproductive freedom as a bothersome impediment to social mobility. But anybody passingly familiar with Hollywood’s unwed-teen-mother melodramas of the 1950s and early ’60s — or who remembers Madonna’s politically suspect teen-pregnancy hit “Papa Don’t Preach” — may find themselves squirming over how the play develops pathos with what seems an unquestioned and one-sided embrace of the inviolable right of witless 16-year-olds to bear children. Act 2 does little to allay such misgivings. That’s when the narrative’s POV abruptly shifts to Corie, as she brings Dee up to date on what has happened since their one-and-only 10 minutes together outside a 1964 delivery room. The trauma of their parting has marked the daughter’s life as deeply as it has the mother’s. But a series of adoptions gone bad and an adolescence spent in children’s homes have left the now–25-year-old Corie an angry, cynical and stridently anti-maternal girl. When the two do finally meet, it is only to have Corie, who is now a singer in her new boyfriend’s death-metal band, repeatedly act out her anger with Dee in shockingly wounding ways. And while Hill manages to freshen up the genre’s expected reconciliation through a stroke of unexpected thematic symmetry, it is not before some of the plot’s seams begin to show. Most notable among those is how the two characters don’t seem to have evolved offstage. Cummins ably adds the emotional patina of 25 additional years to Dee, but drama is about relationships, and the script remains awkwardly silent on any husbands or children that might people her past. Hill likewise saddles Corie with a gap that for most women in their 20s is littered with ex-boyfriends. That said, director Tony Abatemarco gets winning performances from all the actors, while matching Hill’s self-consciously imagistic if sometimes overly literary language. The performances are complemented by designer Cindy Lin’s emblematic set of twisting roots and broken greenhouse windows in a staging suffused with as much nostalgia as knowing camp.","locationName":"Skylight Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/lord-of-the-underworlds-home-for-unwed-mothers-8127568","date":"May 12","type":"Theater","address":"1816 1/2 N.

Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program.

(There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

Trump’s election has been astutely described as the last great gasp of “regressive, patriarchal American whiteness,” and it’s hard to forget what that portends for reproductive rights while watching Hill’s affecting story about a 1960s teen mother forever scarred by the loss of her baby to adoption. Partly that’s because both the setting and the subject of Lord of the Underworld’s Home for Unwed Mothers, having its world premiere at Skylight Theatre, is what has been called the “baby scoop era.” That was the period between World War II and the sexual revolution when the uncontested, white patriarchal authority of the middle-class family routinely dealt with the era’s spike in teenage pregnancies through the forced separation and adoption of the child from its underage mother. The play is structured as a fancifully time-warped epistolary exchange between mother Dee (the searing Corryn Cummins, in a masterfully heartfelt performance) and daughter Corie (a forceful Michaela Slezak). Adrian Gonzalez and Amy Harmon are the play’s strikingly versatile, quick-change chorus, effortlessly emboding the parents, boyfriends and psychologists who inhabit both of the women’s worlds. Act 1 mostly deals with Dee’s insistently archetypal, circa-1964, middle-American brush with motherhood. Hill puts Dee through the paces of a postwar ideology that saw reproductive freedom as a bothersome impediment to social mobility. But anybody passingly familiar with Hollywood’s unwed-teen-mother melodramas of the 1950s and early ’60s — or who remembers Madonna’s politically suspect teen-pregnancy hit “Papa Don’t Preach” — may find themselves squirming over how the play develops pathos with what seems an unquestioned and one-sided embrace of the inviolable right of witless 16-year-olds to bear children. Act 2 does little to allay such misgivings. That’s when the narrative’s POV abruptly shifts to Corie, as she brings Dee up to date on what has happened since their one-and-only 10 minutes together outside a 1964 delivery room. The trauma of their parting has marked the daughter’s life as deeply as it has the mother’s. But a series of adoptions gone bad and an adolescence spent in children’s homes have left the now–25-year-old Corie an angry, cynical and stridently anti-maternal girl. When the two do finally meet, it is only to have Corie, who is now a singer in her new boyfriend’s death-metal band, repeatedly act out her anger with Dee in shockingly wounding ways. And while Hill manages to freshen up the genre’s expected reconciliation through a stroke of unexpected thematic symmetry, it is not before some of the plot’s seams begin to show. Most notable among those is how the two characters don’t seem to have evolved offstage. Cummins ably adds the emotional patina of 25 additional years to Dee, but drama is about relationships, and the script remains awkwardly silent on any husbands or children that might people her past. Hill likewise saddles Corie with a gap that for most women in their 20s is littered with ex-boyfriends. That said, director Tony Abatemarco gets winning performances from all the actors, while matching Hill’s self-consciously imagistic if sometimes overly literary language. The performances are complemented by designer Cindy Lin’s emblematic set of twisting roots and broken greenhouse windows in a staging suffused with as much nostalgia as knowing camp.","locationName":"Skylight Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/lord-of-the-underworlds-home-for-unwed-mothers-8127568","date":"May 13","type":"Theater","address":"1816 1/2 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program.

Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

Coming together in upstate New York in 1979, the trio of Don Dietrich, Donald Miller and Jim Sauter — whose signature move comes when Dietrich and Sauter put the bells of their saxophones together — have, through records like Barbed Wire Maggots and Snuff Jazz, carved out a singularly brutal sonic landscape in which they have few equals. Tonight, appearing in Los Angeles for the first time in more than 20 years, Borbetomagus perform, answer questions and unveil Jef Mertens’ documentary on the trio, A Pollock of Sound, featuring interviews with Bull Tongue writer Byron Coley, drummer Chris Corsano, Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore, Japanese noise supergroup Hijokaidan and others.","locationName":"Downtown Independent Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/borbetomagus-8198831","date":"May 13","type":"Film Jazz Noise Rock","address":"251 S.

In between energetic, sing-along versions of “Don’t Ask Me Why” and “Uptown Girl,” Joel often incorporates a generous helping of seemingly spontaneous covers tailor-selected for each venue, including regular salutes to The Beach Boys at California shows.

Trump’s election has been astutely described as the last great gasp of “regressive, patriarchal American whiteness,” and it’s hard to forget what that portends for reproductive rights while watching Hill’s affecting story about a 1960s teen mother forever scarred by the loss of her baby to adoption. Partly that’s because both the setting and the subject of Lord of the Underworld’s Home for Unwed Mothers, having its world premiere at Skylight Theatre, is what has been called the “baby scoop era.” That was the period between World War II and the sexual revolution when the uncontested, white patriarchal authority of the middle-class family routinely dealt with the era’s spike in teenage pregnancies through the forced separation and adoption of the child from its underage mother. The play is structured as a fancifully time-warped epistolary exchange between mother Dee (the searing Corryn Cummins, in a masterfully heartfelt performance) and daughter Corie (a forceful Michaela Slezak). Adrian Gonzalez and Amy Harmon are the play’s strikingly versatile, quick-change chorus, effortlessly emboding the parents, boyfriends and psychologists who inhabit both of the women’s worlds. Act 1 mostly deals with Dee’s insistently archetypal, circa-1964, middle-American brush with motherhood. Hill puts Dee through the paces of a postwar ideology that saw reproductive freedom as a bothersome impediment to social mobility. But anybody passingly familiar with Hollywood’s unwed-teen-mother melodramas of the 1950s and early ’60s — or who remembers Madonna’s politically suspect teen-pregnancy hit “Papa Don’t Preach” — may find themselves squirming over how the play develops pathos with what seems an unquestioned and one-sided embrace of the inviolable right of witless 16-year-olds to bear children. Act 2 does little to allay such misgivings. That’s when the narrative’s POV abruptly shifts to Corie, as she brings Dee up to date on what has happened since their one-and-only 10 minutes together outside a 1964 delivery room. The trauma of their parting has marked the daughter’s life as deeply as it has the mother’s. But a series of adoptions gone bad and an adolescence spent in children’s homes have left the now–25-year-old Corie an angry, cynical and stridently anti-maternal girl. When the two do finally meet, it is only to have Corie, who is now a singer in her new boyfriend’s death-metal band, repeatedly act out her anger with Dee in shockingly wounding ways. And while Hill manages to freshen up the genre’s expected reconciliation through a stroke of unexpected thematic symmetry, it is not before some of the plot’s seams begin to show. Most notable among those is how the two characters don’t seem to have evolved offstage. Cummins ably adds the emotional patina of 25 additional years to Dee, but drama is about relationships, and the script remains awkwardly silent on any husbands or children that might people her past. Hill likewise saddles Corie with a gap that for most women in their 20s is littered with ex-boyfriends. That said, director Tony Abatemarco gets winning performances from all the actors, while matching Hill’s self-consciously imagistic if sometimes overly literary language. The performances are complemented by designer Cindy Lin’s emblematic set of twisting roots and broken greenhouse windows in a staging suffused with as much nostalgia as knowing camp.","locationName":"Skylight Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/lord-of-the-underworlds-home-for-unwed-mothers-8127568","date":"May 14","type":"Theater","address":"1816 1/2 N.

Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"May 14","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"May 14","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"May 14","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","address":"601 S.

With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art?

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on.

For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

If you're ready to level up your beer and cheese knowledge, join us as we venture into the beautiful world of Belgium!

Each class is an interactive and social experience where discussion and debate are encouraged! 1. BELGIAN CHEESE - April 17 The first class in this series focuses on Belgian cheese. You will be provided a selection of Belgian cheeses paired with Angel City's beers to enjoy throughout the session. Alex, head curd nerd and owner of Vagabond Cheese, will discuss the history, production, and various styles of Belgian Cheese. 2. BELGIAN BEER - May 15 Certified Cicerones Keith and Dan from Angel City Brewery will take you through a history of Belgian brewing and how those historical styles developed in the Belgian ales we know and love! You will receive a flight of Belgian Ales paired with Vagabond's artisan cheese to enjoy throughout the class. 3. ALL-BELGIAN PAIRINGS - June 19 In the last session, we will take all the knowledge gained from our previous sessions and learn how to apply it to a pairing grid! The most interactive session of the series, you will create your own pairing exclusively featuring Belgian Cheeses and Belgian Ales with the guidance of Alex, Keith, and Dan!

As if this was not strange enough, he has the head of a chicken. Oh! Yes, people sometimes buy fried chicken in a bucket. But there is no fried chicken advertised anywhere. And so he stands there, out of place, out of time, carrying with him a certain past we can only imagine. The chicken man is not afraid of being ridiculous or obsolete. He stands tall. Behind him, a tiny theater invites guest with a defiantly huge sign: HIGHLAND THEATER Welcome to the rebellious soul of Highland Park where Plein Les Mirettes was conceived: a bold and unruly child, born to break the laws of chains, of the reassuringly familiar shops and restaurants. French-born artist Stephane Kardos found in Highland Park a treasure trove for the curious soul: an irreverent tribute to difference in a modern urban landscape often plagued by uniformity. Plein Les Mirettes is a French expression to describe astonishment, the type that leaves your eyes wanting more; as such it is perfect to encapsulate the eclectic energy of his art. Exuberant vintage cars from a glamorous era still exhibit bright colors in spite of their brown age spots; graffiti explode in chaotic colors and whimsical patterns; intricate Victorian houses defy modern architecture and the statue of a shark stands confidently in front of a messy collection of hand-painted signs. In front of our eyes comes alive a city that won’t apologize for its grit.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

The series explores the music tied to pivotal moments in history. From the March on Washington to the riots at Stonewall – every episode will illuminate how music has played an integral role in celebrating, criticizing, and amplifying these seismic events in our collective history. The episode, \"The Fall of the Berlin Wall,\" charts the course of the Cold War in Berlin through music revealing how it helped to sow the seeds of rebellion. After the Wall officially came down in 1989, a number of artists, including Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, put on concerts to celebrate. But it was a German band, the Scorpions, who came up with the true anthem of that moment in time, \"Wind of Change,\" which captured the bittersweet emotions behind such a dramatic moment in history. Following the screening, there will be a panel discussion featuring Justin Jampol, founder and current executive director of The Wende Museum of the Cold War. The evening will be hosted by GRAMMY Museum Executive Director Scott Goldman. This program is free.

Huynh’s current work probes questions of cultural perception and cultural authenticity through images of the Asian female body vis-à-vis plastic surgery. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. Huynh’s exhibition Pretty Hurts references Chinese foot-binding as one of the earliest forms of cosmetic surgery to contrast the antiquated canon of Asian feminine beauty (small feet, small eyes, a broad forehead, and small breasts) with the current trends of body image influenced by western canons that call for larger eyes, a delicate forehead, a taller nose, and larger breasts. She is interested in how contemporary plastic surgery on Asian women has not only obscured racial identity, but how it has also amplified the exoticism and Orientalist eroticism of Asian women. Therefore, the awkward synthesis of her projects of traditional and non-traditional, of east and west, unravel ideas of cultural representations and stereotypes to challenge how we consume and interpret ethnographic signifiers. Phung Huynh’s work investigates notions of cultural identity from a kaleidoscopic perspective, a continual shift of idiosyncratic translations. She explores how “outside” cultural ideas are imported, disassembled, and then reconstructed, within the American landscape. Dismantling cultural authenticity, she paints images of Chinese cherubs, lotus, carp and silk textile designs with a “pop” veneer that collide in a complicated composition of delight and horror to challenge the viewer with a western-leaning perspective, as well as the viewer with a nonwestern-leaning perspective. In an overwhelmingly diverse metropolis such as Los Angeles, images flood our social lens through mass reproduction and social media, taking on multiple [mis]interpretations. Such reflections have guided Huynh in re-stitching traditional Chinese iconography within the loosely woven fabric of American popular culture. There is a purposeful “Chinatown” aesthetic in Huynh’s paintings, alluding to kitsch souvenirs that tourists purchase and commoditization of eastern icons into tchotchkes. Phung Huynh has had solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside and the Sam Lee Gallery in LA. Her paintings and drawings have been exhibited nationally and internationally in countries such as Germany and Cambodia. She has also completed public art commissions for the Metro Orange Line, Metro Silver Line, and the Los Angeles Zoo. Huynh is Associate Professor of Art at Los Angeles Valley College. She completed undergraduate coursework at the University of Southern California, received her BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and her MFA from New York University.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/phung-huynh-pretty-hurts-8112892","date":"May 16","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA.

This exhibition marks at once a new direction in Trujillo’s work and a return to a medium he has used in the past, integrating technology into his practice. As in his late 90’s through the early 2000’s work, the computer is a prime tool in his art-making process but the new work also uses digital processes along with the use of the laser cutter. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. The questions Trujillo asks in his new body of work include: What happens when machines can do most physical tasks better than any human could? Will we soon need to deal with questions like this in many areas of our lives? The issues and problems are extremely complex and the processes for resolving them are more than likely not peaceful. Reflecting this in the work for his exhibition, the pieces reference concepts on a macro scale, the topography of cities, the intricate connections of global computer networks, the complex structure of digital viruses. They reflect a new era, a new era of chaos. Mesmerized by the laser cutter when he first saw it at work, Trujillo knew it was something he wanted to explore and make art with. It quietly and smoothly moved across the work surface cutting and engraving with a speed and precision that the greatest human craftsman could never attain with a lifetime of practice. The artist realized that this device, along with other technologies like 3D printing, robotics etc. had reached a price point where they are now affordable to a mass consumer-market, represented the beginning of a new era of technological production that will rival the industrial revolution in its ability to transform our lives and this planet. While he was elated about this idea and the wonders we will create, the more he contemplated this the more he dreaded the monsters it would bring. Osvaldo Trujillo is a visual artist and professor, based in Los Angeles. In addition to past exhibitions at CB1 Gallery, his work has been shown at POST Gallery, Peggy Phelps Gallery, Art FrankFurt, Germany. He is currently represented by CB1 Gallery, Los Angeles, CA. Trujillo graduated with an MFA from Claremont Graduate University, Los Angeles and teaches at at USC.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/osvaldo-trujillo-of-our-time-8112894","date":"May 16","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

A symbol that is usually associated with this myth is the melting pot, which appears instructive on the surface until we begin to ask questions of it. Who is doing the melting, and what is the result? What is lost and what is gained in the melting? Is it language, culture, identity?

As if this was not strange enough, he has the head of a chicken. Oh! Yes, people sometimes buy fried chicken in a bucket. But there is no fried chicken advertised anywhere. And so he stands there, out of place, out of time, carrying with him a certain past we can only imagine. The chicken man is not afraid of being ridiculous or obsolete. He stands tall. Behind him, a tiny theater invites guest with a defiantly huge sign: HIGHLAND THEATER Welcome to the rebellious soul of Highland Park where Plein Les Mirettes was conceived: a bold and unruly child, born to break the laws of chains, of the reassuringly familiar shops and restaurants. French-born artist Stephane Kardos found in Highland Park a treasure trove for the curious soul: an irreverent tribute to difference in a modern urban landscape often plagued by uniformity. Plein Les Mirettes is a French expression to describe astonishment, the type that leaves your eyes wanting more; as such it is perfect to encapsulate the eclectic energy of his art. Exuberant vintage cars from a glamorous era still exhibit bright colors in spite of their brown age spots; graffiti explode in chaotic colors and whimsical patterns; intricate Victorian houses defy modern architecture and the statue of a shark stands confidently in front of a messy collection of hand-painted signs. In front of our eyes comes alive a city that won’t apologize for its grit. With his art, Stephane Kardos pays tribute to its streets whose living history wake in us an eagerness to keep exploring.","locationName":"Civil Coffee","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/plein-les-mirettes-the-art-of-being-astonishing-7918156","date":"May 16","type":"Arts & Culture","address":"5629 N Figueroa St Los Angeles, Ca 90042 818-238-7262"},{"name":"Rejuvenate x Illuminate: Recycled Art & Trashion by...","summary":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles is pleased to present an exhibition of works by Taiwanese artist Chin-Chih Yang, titled “Rejuvenate x Illuminate,” in honor of celebrating Earth Day and raising environmental awareness through art. Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"May 16","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Tijuana Foodie Adventure","summary":"Join Wild Foodie Adventures for an all-inclusive, fun, gritty, and insightful food tour in Tijuana!

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

The design collective Škart made these maps with refugees who are currently living in a refugee camp in Banja Kovilja?a, Serbia.

Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"May 17","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Huynh’s current work probes questions of cultural perception and cultural authenticity through images of the Asian female body vis-à-vis plastic surgery. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. Huynh’s exhibition Pretty Hurts references Chinese foot-binding as one of the earliest forms of cosmetic surgery to contrast the antiquated canon of Asian feminine beauty (small feet, small eyes, a broad forehead, and small breasts) with the current trends of body image influenced by western canons that call for larger eyes, a delicate forehead, a taller nose, and larger breasts. She is interested in how contemporary plastic surgery on Asian women has not only obscured racial identity, but how it has also amplified the exoticism and Orientalist eroticism of Asian women. Therefore, the awkward synthesis of her projects of traditional and non-traditional, of east and west, unravel ideas of cultural representations and stereotypes to challenge how we consume and interpret ethnographic signifiers. Phung Huynh’s work investigates notions of cultural identity from a kaleidoscopic perspective, a continual shift of idiosyncratic translations. She explores how “outside” cultural ideas are imported, disassembled, and then reconstructed, within the American landscape. Dismantling cultural authenticity, she paints images of Chinese cherubs, lotus, carp and silk textile designs with a “pop” veneer that collide in a complicated composition of delight and horror to challenge the viewer with a western-leaning perspective, as well as the viewer with a nonwestern-leaning perspective. In an overwhelmingly diverse metropolis such as Los Angeles, images flood our social lens through mass reproduction and social media, taking on multiple [mis]interpretations. Such reflections have guided Huynh in re-stitching traditional Chinese iconography within the loosely woven fabric of American popular culture. There is a purposeful “Chinatown” aesthetic in Huynh’s paintings, alluding to kitsch souvenirs that tourists purchase and commoditization of eastern icons into tchotchkes. Phung Huynh has had solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside and the Sam Lee Gallery in LA. Her paintings and drawings have been exhibited nationally and internationally in countries such as Germany and Cambodia. She has also completed public art commissions for the Metro Orange Line, Metro Silver Line, and the Los Angeles Zoo. Huynh is Associate Professor of Art at Los Angeles Valley College. She completed undergraduate coursework at the University of Southern California, received her BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and her MFA from New York University.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/phung-huynh-pretty-hurts-8112892","date":"May 17","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"May 17","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Osvaldo Trujillo: \"Of Our Time\"","summary":"For his third solo exhibition at CB1 Gallery, we are pleased to present \"Of Our Time,\" Osvaldo Trujillo’s exhibition of painted and laser cut acrylic. This exhibition marks at once a new direction in Trujillo’s work and a return to a medium he has used in the past, integrating technology into his practice. As in his late 90’s through the early 2000’s work, the computer is a prime tool in his art-making process but the new work also uses digital processes along with the use of the laser cutter. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. The questions Trujillo asks in his new body of work include: What happens when machines can do most physical tasks better than any human could? Will we soon need to deal with questions like this in many areas of our lives? The issues and problems are extremely complex and the processes for resolving them are more than likely not peaceful. Reflecting this in the work for his exhibition, the pieces reference concepts on a macro scale, the topography of cities, the intricate connections of global computer networks, the complex structure of digital viruses. They reflect a new era, a new era of chaos. Mesmerized by the laser cutter when he first saw it at work, Trujillo knew it was something he wanted to explore and make art with. It quietly and smoothly moved across the work surface cutting and engraving with a speed and precision that the greatest human craftsman could never attain with a lifetime of practice. The artist realized that this device, along with other technologies like 3D printing, robotics etc. had reached a price point where they are now affordable to a mass consumer-market, represented the beginning of a new era of technological production that will rival the industrial revolution in its ability to transform our lives and this planet. While he was elated about this idea and the wonders we will create, the more he contemplated this the more he dreaded the monsters it would bring. Osvaldo Trujillo is a visual artist and professor, based in Los Angeles. In addition to past exhibitions at CB1 Gallery, his work has been shown at POST Gallery, Peggy Phelps Gallery, Art FrankFurt, Germany. He is currently represented by CB1 Gallery, Los Angeles, CA.

The affected posturing of fashion models is combined with the purely instinctual behavior of animals in unpredictable, amusing and provocative ways. A smug-looking cat struts in designer jeans; a tiny bespectacled rabbit head disappears into the body of a rail-thin model wearing a luxurious coat; a muscular dog-headed tennis player gazes lovingly into the human-featured shaggy dog that lies cradled in his arms, against the setting of an ocean sunset. Like most of the idyllic nature scenes that serve as the backdrops of Hiltunen’s collages, it is turned sideways, adding to the beguilingly off-kilter charm. Direct and intense, the stunning reversals and inversions of these images reflect the care dedicated to their creation. Taken from fashion catalogs and travel magazines, Hiltunen invests substantial time arranging the components, laying them out on a table and considering the various options before achieving exactly the right effect.

As if this was not strange enough, he has the head of a chicken. Oh! Yes, people sometimes buy fried chicken in a bucket. But there is no fried chicken advertised anywhere. And so he stands there, out of place, out of time, carrying with him a certain past we can only imagine. The chicken man is not afraid of being ridiculous or obsolete. He stands tall. Behind him, a tiny theater invites guest with a defiantly huge sign: HIGHLAND THEATER Welcome to the rebellious soul of Highland Park where Plein Les Mirettes was conceived: a bold and unruly child, born to break the laws of chains, of the reassuringly familiar shops and restaurants. French-born artist Stephane Kardos found in Highland Park a treasure trove for the curious soul: an irreverent tribute to difference in a modern urban landscape often plagued by uniformity. Plein Les Mirettes is a French expression to describe astonishment, the type that leaves your eyes wanting more; as such it is perfect to encapsulate the eclectic energy of his art. Exuberant vintage cars from a glamorous era still exhibit bright colors in spite of their brown age spots; graffiti explode in chaotic colors and whimsical patterns; intricate Victorian houses defy modern architecture and the statue of a shark stands confidently in front of a messy collection of hand-painted signs. In front of our eyes comes alive a city that won’t apologize for its grit.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"May 18","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","address":"601 S.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"May 18","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

You may recognize \"Convoy's\" trio of performers as the ingeniously helpful losers Swift, Blodget and Gunt from FX's short-lived Terriers.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"May 18","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Michael Kiwanuka","summary":"By Lily Moayeri With his old-soul voice and beautiful guitar playing, Michael Kiwanuka delivers a singularly impressive take on vintage sounds. His 2012 debut, Home Again, was fresh in its classic, dusty vibe, but it’s on his second album, 2016’s immaculate Love & Hate, that he comes into his own. Suited to the present time but rooted in the past, Kiwanuka’s music was a great fit for Netflix’s series The Get Down, about the origins of hip-hop, for which Nas reworked Love & Hate favorites “Black Man in a White World (Ghetto Gettysburg Address)” and “Rule the World (I Came From the City)” with his own rhymes. Live, Kiwanuka is in his own world. Deeply immersed in the songs, he unexpectedly breaks up the isolation with the most hilarious banter.

It seems there is now a place for such sophisticated artistry, especially if blended cleverly into new hybrid concoctions. Kathleen Grace sipped at the deep well of jazz for years before veering off her chosen path into the countryside, where she now frolics in a space where all tastes are safe, be it country, bluegrass or jazz. In her most recent album, No Place to Fall, Grace’s bright, clear voice reflects simple beauty and subtle wisdom, traits shared by all memorable singers from Billie Holiday to Emmylou Harris. Grace’s band includes some of the best multigenre instrumentalists around: Punch Brothers violinist Gabe Witcher, bassist David Piltch, drummer Matt Mayhall and guitarists Tim Young and Storm Nilson.","locationName":"Blue Whale","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/kathleen-grace-8198197","date":"May 18","type":"Americana Country Jazz Pop Rock","address":"123 Astronaut E.S.

The legendary pedal steel guitarist, who replaced Tom Brumley in Buck Owens’ Buckaroos circa ’69, is an incomparable musician with impeccable taste and an impressive trove of stellar credits. Maness’ warm, expressive style — always complementary, never overplayed — made him an in-demand sideman, and he has recorded with everyone from Gram Parsons and The Byrds to Charlie Rich and Waylon Jennings.

The affected posturing of fashion models is combined with the purely instinctual behavior of animals in unpredictable, amusing and provocative ways. A smug-looking cat struts in designer jeans; a tiny bespectacled rabbit head disappears into the body of a rail-thin model wearing a luxurious coat; a muscular dog-headed tennis player gazes lovingly into the human-featured shaggy dog that lies cradled in his arms, against the setting of an ocean sunset. Like most of the idyllic nature scenes that serve as the backdrops of Hiltunen’s collages, it is turned sideways, adding to the beguilingly off-kilter charm. Direct and intense, the stunning reversals and inversions of these images reflect the care dedicated to their creation. Taken from fashion catalogs and travel magazines, Hiltunen invests substantial time arranging the components, laying them out on a table and considering the various options before achieving exactly the right effect. A Kentuckian by birth, John Hiltunen currently resides in Fremont, California and attends the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland - a world-renowned art studio that serves artists with mental and developmental disabilities.

Huynh’s current work probes questions of cultural perception and cultural authenticity through images of the Asian female body vis-à-vis plastic surgery. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. Huynh’s exhibition Pretty Hurts references Chinese foot-binding as one of the earliest forms of cosmetic surgery to contrast the antiquated canon of Asian feminine beauty (small feet, small eyes, a broad forehead, and small breasts) with the current trends of body image influenced by western canons that call for larger eyes, a delicate forehead, a taller nose, and larger breasts. She is interested in how contemporary plastic surgery on Asian women has not only obscured racial identity, but how it has also amplified the exoticism and Orientalist eroticism of Asian women. Therefore, the awkward synthesis of her projects of traditional and non-traditional, of east and west, unravel ideas of cultural representations and stereotypes to challenge how we consume and interpret ethnographic signifiers. Phung Huynh’s work investigates notions of cultural identity from a kaleidoscopic perspective, a continual shift of idiosyncratic translations. She explores how “outside” cultural ideas are imported, disassembled, and then reconstructed, within the American landscape. Dismantling cultural authenticity, she paints images of Chinese cherubs, lotus, carp and silk textile designs with a “pop” veneer that collide in a complicated composition of delight and horror to challenge the viewer with a western-leaning perspective, as well as the viewer with a nonwestern-leaning perspective. In an overwhelmingly diverse metropolis such as Los Angeles, images flood our social lens through mass reproduction and social media, taking on multiple [mis]interpretations. Such reflections have guided Huynh in re-stitching traditional Chinese iconography within the loosely woven fabric of American popular culture. There is a purposeful “Chinatown” aesthetic in Huynh’s paintings, alluding to kitsch souvenirs that tourists purchase and commoditization of eastern icons into tchotchkes. Phung Huynh has had solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside and the Sam Lee Gallery in LA. Her paintings and drawings have been exhibited nationally and internationally in countries such as Germany and Cambodia. She has also completed public art commissions for the Metro Orange Line, Metro Silver Line, and the Los Angeles Zoo. Huynh is Associate Professor of Art at Los Angeles Valley College. She completed undergraduate coursework at the University of Southern California, received her BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and her MFA from New York University.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/phung-huynh-pretty-hurts-8112892","date":"May 18","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"May 18","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

This exhibition marks at once a new direction in Trujillo’s work and a return to a medium he has used in the past, integrating technology into his practice. As in his late 90’s through the early 2000’s work, the computer is a prime tool in his art-making process but the new work also uses digital processes along with the use of the laser cutter. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. The questions Trujillo asks in his new body of work include: What happens when machines can do most physical tasks better than any human could? Will we soon need to deal with questions like this in many areas of our lives? The issues and problems are extremely complex and the processes for resolving them are more than likely not peaceful. Reflecting this in the work for his exhibition, the pieces reference concepts on a macro scale, the topography of cities, the intricate connections of global computer networks, the complex structure of digital viruses. They reflect a new era, a new era of chaos. Mesmerized by the laser cutter when he first saw it at work, Trujillo knew it was something he wanted to explore and make art with. It quietly and smoothly moved across the work surface cutting and engraving with a speed and precision that the greatest human craftsman could never attain with a lifetime of practice. The artist realized that this device, along with other technologies like 3D printing, robotics etc. had reached a price point where they are now affordable to a mass consumer-market, represented the beginning of a new era of technological production that will rival the industrial revolution in its ability to transform our lives and this planet. While he was elated about this idea and the wonders we will create, the more he contemplated this the more he dreaded the monsters it would bring. Osvaldo Trujillo is a visual artist and professor, based in Los Angeles. In addition to past exhibitions at CB1 Gallery, his work has been shown at POST Gallery, Peggy Phelps Gallery, Art FrankFurt, Germany. He is currently represented by CB1 Gallery, Los Angeles, CA.

And so he stands there, out of place, out of time, carrying with him a certain past we can only imagine. The chicken man is not afraid of being ridiculous or obsolete. He stands tall.

Plein Les Mirettes is a French expression to describe astonishment, the type that leaves your eyes wanting more; as such it is perfect to encapsulate the eclectic energy of his art.

The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"May 18","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Eugene O'Neill's Ah, Wilderness!","summary":"","locationName":"A Noise Within","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/eugene-oneills-ah-wilderness-7983076","date":"May 18","type":"Theater","address":"3352 E.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass. It’s usually full on Friday nights — by 9 or 10 p.m., you can’t move without brushing up against someone else. Aluminum ashtrays made from melted PBR cans sit on the counter.","locationName":"The Mackey Apartments","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-los-bar-5847342","date":"May 19","type":"Art Museums","address":"1137 S.

The organization is just five years old on a Sunday morning in June, 1915, when Dr. Du Bois and Miss Ovington are the sole occupants of the NAACP office in New York. Du Bois is Black. Miss Ovington is white. Both are opposed to the oppression of people of color. Dr. Du Bois is intent on resigning from the NAACP, infuriated by the condescension and opposition he has received from white board members of the organization. Miss Ovington believes such a move would be disastrous both for himself and the organization, and she attempts to dissuade him from what she is convinced is a destructive course of action. Complicating matters is the pair’s evident attraction to each other, a relationship that would be widely condemned in 1915.

This time Froggy has brought along a pathologically shy young man named Charlie who is overcome with fear at the thought of making conversation with strangers. So Froggy tells everyone that Charlie is from an exotic foreign country and speaks no English. The fun begins when Charlie overhears more than he should — hilarious and damaging revelations made with the belief that Charlie doesn't understand a word of English. The fact that only Charlie and the audience are in on the joke fuels the nonstop hilarity of the play and sets up the wildly funny climax in which things go uproariously awry for the \"bad guys,\" and the \"good guys\" emerge triumphant. Winner of two Obie Awards and two Outer Critics Circle Awards as Best New American Play and Best Off-Broadway Production. Based on what the NY Post describes as a \"devilishly clever idea,\" the play demonstrates what can happen when a group of devious characters must deal with a stranger who (they think) knows no English.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"May 19","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Huynh’s current work probes questions of cultural perception and cultural authenticity through images of the Asian female body vis-à-vis plastic surgery. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. Huynh’s exhibition Pretty Hurts references Chinese foot-binding as one of the earliest forms of cosmetic surgery to contrast the antiquated canon of Asian feminine beauty (small feet, small eyes, a broad forehead, and small breasts) with the current trends of body image influenced by western canons that call for larger eyes, a delicate forehead, a taller nose, and larger breasts. She is interested in how contemporary plastic surgery on Asian women has not only obscured racial identity, but how it has also amplified the exoticism and Orientalist eroticism of Asian women. Therefore, the awkward synthesis of her projects of traditional and non-traditional, of east and west, unravel ideas of cultural representations and stereotypes to challenge how we consume and interpret ethnographic signifiers. Phung Huynh’s work investigates notions of cultural identity from a kaleidoscopic perspective, a continual shift of idiosyncratic translations. She explores how “outside” cultural ideas are imported, disassembled, and then reconstructed, within the American landscape. Dismantling cultural authenticity, she paints images of Chinese cherubs, lotus, carp and silk textile designs with a “pop” veneer that collide in a complicated composition of delight and horror to challenge the viewer with a western-leaning perspective, as well as the viewer with a nonwestern-leaning perspective. In an overwhelmingly diverse metropolis such as Los Angeles, images flood our social lens through mass reproduction and social media, taking on multiple [mis]interpretations. Such reflections have guided Huynh in re-stitching traditional Chinese iconography within the loosely woven fabric of American popular culture. There is a purposeful “Chinatown” aesthetic in Huynh’s paintings, alluding to kitsch souvenirs that tourists purchase and commoditization of eastern icons into tchotchkes. Phung Huynh has had solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside and the Sam Lee Gallery in LA. Her paintings and drawings have been exhibited nationally and internationally in countries such as Germany and Cambodia. She has also completed public art commissions for the Metro Orange Line, Metro Silver Line, and the Los Angeles Zoo. Huynh is Associate Professor of Art at Los Angeles Valley College. She completed undergraduate coursework at the University of Southern California, received her BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and her MFA from New York University.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/phung-huynh-pretty-hurts-8112892","date":"May 19","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"May 19","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Osvaldo Trujillo: \"Of Our Time\"","summary":"For his third solo exhibition at CB1 Gallery, we are pleased to present \"Of Our Time,\" Osvaldo Trujillo’s exhibition of painted and laser cut acrylic. This exhibition marks at once a new direction in Trujillo’s work and a return to a medium he has used in the past, integrating technology into his practice. As in his late 90’s through the early 2000’s work, the computer is a prime tool in his art-making process but the new work also uses digital processes along with the use of the laser cutter. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. The questions Trujillo asks in his new body of work include: What happens when machines can do most physical tasks better than any human could? Will we soon need to deal with questions like this in many areas of our lives? The issues and problems are extremely complex and the processes for resolving them are more than likely not peaceful. Reflecting this in the work for his exhibition, the pieces reference concepts on a macro scale, the topography of cities, the intricate connections of global computer networks, the complex structure of digital viruses. They reflect a new era, a new era of chaos. Mesmerized by the laser cutter when he first saw it at work, Trujillo knew it was something he wanted to explore and make art with. It quietly and smoothly moved across the work surface cutting and engraving with a speed and precision that the greatest human craftsman could never attain with a lifetime of practice. The artist realized that this device, along with other technologies like 3D printing, robotics etc. had reached a price point where they are now affordable to a mass consumer-market, represented the beginning of a new era of technological production that will rival the industrial revolution in its ability to transform our lives and this planet. While he was elated about this idea and the wonders we will create, the more he contemplated this the more he dreaded the monsters it would bring. Osvaldo Trujillo is a visual artist and professor, based in Los Angeles. In addition to past exhibitions at CB1 Gallery, his work has been shown at POST Gallery, Peggy Phelps Gallery, Art FrankFurt, Germany. He is currently represented by CB1 Gallery, Los Angeles, CA.

The design collective Škart made these maps with refugees who are currently living in a refugee camp in Banja Kovilja?a, Serbia. Simple and immediately legible despite halting English, they tell dramatic, sometimes violent stories in short hand. Co-curated by Thomas Keenan and Sohrab Mohebbi, the show uses maps to explore and trace recent and ongoing migration between the Middle East, Africa and Europe.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"May 20","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Derrick Adams: \"Network\"","summary":"By Catherine Wagley \"Colorful has taught them that they don't need a man,\" an actress says in artist Derrick Adams' short film On. \"They need Colorful.\" The actress holds a cardboard box with the word \"Colorful\" collaged onto it, and stands on a comically DIY set.

They're enthusiastic if confusing. A girl-guy team peddles \"More for Less\" by saying it's just nice sometimes to have more, especially when it's for less. Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"May 20","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"May 21","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Derrick Adams: \"Network\"","summary":"By Catherine Wagley \"Colorful has taught them that they don't need a man,\" an actress says in artist Derrick Adams' short film On. \"They need Colorful.\" The actress holds a cardboard box with the word \"Colorful\" collaged onto it, and stands on a comically DIY set.

Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"May 21","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"May 22","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

The San Marino Historical Society is pleased to have the Executive Director of El Molino Viejo, Cathy Brown, share some its stories on Monday, May 22 at 7:00 p.m. in the Library’s Barth Community Room. In its speakers series at Crowell Public Library, the San Marino Historical Society presents quarterly programs focusing on topics especially selected for residents of San Marino. These talks are free and open to the public. In 2002, Cathy Brown began work at the Old Mill as the Assistant Director. She is a graduate of UCLA with a BA in History. She will talk about the history of El Molino Viejo and the people who have made it a home and those that have influenced its history. She and John Quinn, President of the Old Mill Foundation, will conclude with a review of the Old Mill Foundation's plans for this special year. Completed about 1816 as a grist mill for Mission San Gabriel, the original two-story structure of the Old Mill measured 53 by 26 feet. The lower walls are five feet thick and are composed of oven-baked brick and volcanic tuff, while the walls of the upper level are built of layers of sun-dried adobe slabs. The present entrance room (with its collection of antique paintings and furnishings) served as the grinding room of the mill. The top level was originally used as the granary, where the milled grain was stored. The California Art Club maintains an art gallery there today.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"May 22","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

As if this was not strange enough, he has the head of a chicken. Oh! Yes, people sometimes buy fried chicken in a bucket. But there is no fried chicken advertised anywhere. And so he stands there, out of place, out of time, carrying with him a certain past we can only imagine. The chicken man is not afraid of being ridiculous or obsolete. He stands tall. Behind him, a tiny theater invites guest with a defiantly huge sign: HIGHLAND THEATER Welcome to the rebellious soul of Highland Park where Plein Les Mirettes was conceived: a bold and unruly child, born to break the laws of chains, of the reassuringly familiar shops and restaurants. French-born artist Stephane Kardos found in Highland Park a treasure trove for the curious soul: an irreverent tribute to difference in a modern urban landscape often plagued by uniformity. Plein Les Mirettes is a French expression to describe astonishment, the type that leaves your eyes wanting more; as such it is perfect to encapsulate the eclectic energy of his art. Exuberant vintage cars from a glamorous era still exhibit bright colors in spite of their brown age spots; graffiti explode in chaotic colors and whimsical patterns; intricate Victorian houses defy modern architecture and the statue of a shark stands confidently in front of a messy collection of hand-painted signs. In front of our eyes comes alive a city that won’t apologize for its grit. With his art, Stephane Kardos pays tribute to its streets whose living history wake in us an eagerness to keep exploring.","locationName":"Civil Coffee","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/plein-les-mirettes-the-art-of-being-astonishing-7918156","date":"May 22","type":"Arts & Culture","address":"5629 N Figueroa St Los Angeles, Ca 90042 818-238-7262"},{"name":"Audio Tour of Chinatown by L.A.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

A big, fake TV screen made of fabric squares and plastic hangs on the wall behind her. Several actors peddle cardboard boxes in On, pitching their products as if on a morning show or infomercial. They're enthusiastic if confusing. A girl-guy team peddles \"More for Less\" by saying it's just nice sometimes to have more, especially when it's for less. Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty. Regis and Kathie Lee they are not, but what role do they play, exactly?

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited.

Huynh’s current work probes questions of cultural perception and cultural authenticity through images of the Asian female body vis-à-vis plastic surgery. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. Huynh’s exhibition Pretty Hurts references Chinese foot-binding as one of the earliest forms of cosmetic surgery to contrast the antiquated canon of Asian feminine beauty (small feet, small eyes, a broad forehead, and small breasts) with the current trends of body image influenced by western canons that call for larger eyes, a delicate forehead, a taller nose, and larger breasts. She is interested in how contemporary plastic surgery on Asian women has not only obscured racial identity, but how it has also amplified the exoticism and Orientalist eroticism of Asian women. Therefore, the awkward synthesis of her projects of traditional and non-traditional, of east and west, unravel ideas of cultural representations and stereotypes to challenge how we consume and interpret ethnographic signifiers. Phung Huynh’s work investigates notions of cultural identity from a kaleidoscopic perspective, a continual shift of idiosyncratic translations. She explores how “outside” cultural ideas are imported, disassembled, and then reconstructed, within the American landscape. Dismantling cultural authenticity, she paints images of Chinese cherubs, lotus, carp and silk textile designs with a “pop” veneer that collide in a complicated composition of delight and horror to challenge the viewer with a western-leaning perspective, as well as the viewer with a nonwestern-leaning perspective. In an overwhelmingly diverse metropolis such as Los Angeles, images flood our social lens through mass reproduction and social media, taking on multiple [mis]interpretations. Such reflections have guided Huynh in re-stitching traditional Chinese iconography within the loosely woven fabric of American popular culture. There is a purposeful “Chinatown” aesthetic in Huynh’s paintings, alluding to kitsch souvenirs that tourists purchase and commoditization of eastern icons into tchotchkes. Phung Huynh has had solo exhibitions at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills and the Sweeney Art Gallery at the University of California, Riverside and the Sam Lee Gallery in LA. Her paintings and drawings have been exhibited nationally and internationally in countries such as Germany and Cambodia. She has also completed public art commissions for the Metro Orange Line, Metro Silver Line, and the Los Angeles Zoo. Huynh is Associate Professor of Art at Los Angeles Valley College. She completed undergraduate coursework at the University of Southern California, received her BFA from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and her MFA from New York University.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/phung-huynh-pretty-hurts-8112892","date":"May 23","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"May 23","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Osvaldo Trujillo: \"Of Our Time\"","summary":"For his third solo exhibition at CB1 Gallery, we are pleased to present \"Of Our Time,\" Osvaldo Trujillo’s exhibition of painted and laser cut acrylic. This exhibition marks at once a new direction in Trujillo’s work and a return to a medium he has used in the past, integrating technology into his practice. As in his late 90’s through the early 2000’s work, the computer is a prime tool in his art-making process but the new work also uses digital processes along with the use of the laser cutter. The exhibition will be on view from April 15 through May 27, 2017. The gallery will host a reception for the artist on Saturday, April 15 from 4 – 7 p.m. The questions Trujillo asks in his new body of work include: What happens when machines can do most physical tasks better than any human could? Will we soon need to deal with questions like this in many areas of our lives? The issues and problems are extremely complex and the processes for resolving them are more than likely not peaceful. Reflecting this in the work for his exhibition, the pieces reference concepts on a macro scale, the topography of cities, the intricate connections of global computer networks, the complex structure of digital viruses. They reflect a new era, a new era of chaos. Mesmerized by the laser cutter when he first saw it at work, Trujillo knew it was something he wanted to explore and make art with. It quietly and smoothly moved across the work surface cutting and engraving with a speed and precision that the greatest human craftsman could never attain with a lifetime of practice. The artist realized that this device, along with other technologies like 3D printing, robotics etc. had reached a price point where they are now affordable to a mass consumer-market, represented the beginning of a new era of technological production that will rival the industrial revolution in its ability to transform our lives and this planet. While he was elated about this idea and the wonders we will create, the more he contemplated this the more he dreaded the monsters it would bring. Osvaldo Trujillo is a visual artist and professor, based in Los Angeles. In addition to past exhibitions at CB1 Gallery, his work has been shown at POST Gallery, Peggy Phelps Gallery, Art FrankFurt, Germany. He is currently represented by CB1 Gallery, Los Angeles, CA. Trujillo graduated with an MFA from Claremont Graduate University, Los Angeles and teaches at at USC.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/osvaldo-trujillo-of-our-time-8112894","date":"May 23","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","address":"1923 S.

As if this was not strange enough, he has the head of a chicken. Oh! Yes, people sometimes buy fried chicken in a bucket. But there is no fried chicken advertised anywhere. And so he stands there, out of place, out of time, carrying with him a certain past we can only imagine. The chicken man is not afraid of being ridiculous or obsolete. He stands tall. Behind him, a tiny theater invites guest with a defiantly huge sign: HIGHLAND THEATER Welcome to the rebellious soul of Highland Park where Plein Les Mirettes was conceived: a bold and unruly child, born to break the laws of chains, of the reassuringly familiar shops and restaurants. French-born artist Stephane Kardos found in Highland Park a treasure trove for the curious soul: an irreverent tribute to difference in a modern urban landscape often plagued by uniformity. Plein Les Mirettes is a French expression to describe astonishment, the type that leaves your eyes wanting more; as such it is perfect to encapsulate the eclectic energy of his art. Exuberant vintage cars from a glamorous era still exhibit bright colors in spite of their brown age spots; graffiti explode in chaotic colors and whimsical patterns; intricate Victorian houses defy modern architecture and the statue of a shark stands confidently in front of a messy collection of hand-painted signs. In front of our eyes comes alive a city that won’t apologize for its grit. With his art, Stephane Kardos pays tribute to its streets whose living history wake in us an eagerness to keep exploring.","locationName":"Civil Coffee","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/plein-les-mirettes-the-art-of-being-astonishing-7918156","date":"May 23","type":"Arts & Culture","address":"5629 N Figueroa St Los Angeles, Ca 90042 818-238-7262"},{"name":"The Basilisk","summary":"The Basilisk Summoned by Aaron Moulton 4.4444.5777 Holy Saturday, 7:00pm Beings stumbling through darkness hath seen Great Light above; on those residing in the eternal void, the unclenching grasp of the Omul Negru, the Basilisk has arisen.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.
