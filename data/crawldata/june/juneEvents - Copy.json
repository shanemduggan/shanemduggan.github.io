[{"name":"The Road Warrior","summary":"By Nate Bell The Road Warrior (1981) initially was widely regarded as a leaner, louder, more muscular do-over of George Miller's Mad Max. Mel Gibson reprises his role as the rogue cop who finds himself defending, in the style of an old Western, a tight-knit community of post-nuclear desert dwellers against a pack of wheel-bound psychos. The New Beverly will pair it with the recent, universally lauded Mad Max: Fury Road. Miller's belated fourth entry in the series, sturdily supported by a kick-ass Charlize Theron, is a relentlessly exciting chase thriller that adds a potent feminist edge to this testosterone-fueled franchise.","locationName":"New Beverly Cinema","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-road-warrior-8279340","date":"June 2","type":"Theater","address":"7165 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-938-4038"},{"name":"Julieta Venegas","summary":"By Falling James Julieta Venegas first came to attention when she was briefly a member of the subversive Mexican ska-punk band Tijuana No! in the early ’90s.

Venegas has never rocked as hard since then, eschewing politics and rebellion for a more nuanced and gently lulling pop approach on such albums as 2000’s Bueninvento and 2006’s Limón y Sal.

Is he propelled by his own volition or are there other, more sinister individuals or forces pulling the strings? Think of the training camps of ISIS or al-Qaida or portraits of suicide bombers, teenagers prepared to sacrifice their lives to destroy the lives of others, for a cause. Where do they come from and what brought them to this radical point? Loosely based on historical fact, Rajiv Joseph’s droll and penetrating Archduke takes place in Serbia in 1914, and opens in the months prior to the assassination of Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie — an act that precipitated World War I and changed the world forever. The spine of the play is the relationship between three of the youths recruited to carry out the murder (there actually were seven), and the fanatical military officer, Dragutin Dimitrijevic (Patrick Page), who indoctrinates them. While the details are fictional, the characters, including Dimitrijevic, are based on real personages: Gavrilo Princip (Stephen Stocking) who ultimately fired the fatal shots; Nedeljko Cabrinovic (Josiah Bania), who threw a bomb that missed; and a third co-conspirator and friend, Trifko Grabež (Ramiz Monsef) — in this telling of the story, the most together of the three. All three suffered from tuberculosis, and Joseph’s play begins in the examining room of a doctor (Todd Weeks) who tells Gavrilo that he’s ill and has less than a year to live. The sensitive and unworldly Gavrilo is slow to digest the news, and instead chooses to obsess over blood on the doctor’s handkerchief (his own), and the gender of the examining room skeleton (female), which offends his sensibilities as one respectful of the opposite sex. Later, the good doctor is visited by Colonel Dimitrijevic who requests that the physician send him five of his patients to be drafted into service. When the doctor refuses, he’s bullied and threatened with his life until he buckles and complies. There follows an entertaining scene among the three unsuspecting recruits — innocents, basically, who’ve never been with a woman and for whom a hot sandwich is as close to the good life as they hope to get. They’re prime fodder for Page’s incendiary Colonel, a crafty true believer who tempts them with promises of food and a free train ride, while singing the praises of martyrdom and handing each a vial of cyanide. Though broadly framed by historical events, Archduke easily transcends these particulars; its coruscating depiction of the manipulation of the unschooled by a predatory monomaniac is an unhappily timeless (not to mention excruciatingly relevant) phenomenon, and marks it as a play of considerable substance. Plus, Joseph’s characters are drawn with accomplished depth beyond their service to the plot. The production, however, while strong in many places, is weak in others. Under Giovanna Sardelli’s direction, Page proves electrifying as a ruthless (and misogynistic) zealot driven by crazed macho fantasies, while Monsef, who looks first to be the Colonel’s henchman but turns out to be just another gullible kid, is on point from first to last. Unfortunately, both Bania as the slow-witted Nedeljko and Stocking as the pivotal Gavrilo — a 19-year-old whose quest for meaning in his life ultimately rubs up against his will to survive — deliver serviceable performances only, and the show falls short of what it could be. Also, while Tim Mackabee’s scenic design unfolds cleverly in the second half, the action at the top plays out against a drab backdrop with the faces of the performers poorly lit in the design conceived by Lap Chi Chu. While it’s true these characters dwell in grim surroundings, they and the audience deserve more illumination.","locationName":"Mark Taper Forum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archduke-go-8221678","date":"June 2","type":"Theater","address":"135 N.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 2","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Actually — GO!","summary":"By Deborah Klugman In Anna Ziegler’s smart and penetrating play Actually, now premiering at the Geffen Playhouse, Tom (Jerry MacKinnon), a freshman at Princeton, recounts an incident in which his best buddy Sunil leans in and kisses him on the mouth. After the unequivocally heterosexual Tom tells Sunil to back off, the two men never mention it again, and they resume their friendship as before. How different, observes Tom, from his experience with women, who are “incapable of moving on even if you make out once for five minutes on a fucking dance floor.” As portrayed by MacKinnon, Tom is an attractive guy who scores lots of casual sex but is otherwise not especially worldly or predatory. Instead, he’s a lower-middle-class African-American kid who plays classical piano and has painstakingly made his way into the Ivy League. But now his future is threatened; a female freshman, a Jewish coed named Amber (Samantha Ressler), has accused him of rape, and he’s been called upon to face a three-person panel who will determine how much truth her statement holds. If her word is taken over his, Tom’s future may be toast. To Tom, his predicament is bewildering; he’d been under the impression that Amber liked him and wanted to be intimate, moreover, he’d liked her as well, despite her awkward manner and sometimes tactless remarks, such as assuming he got into Princeton because he was black. In fact, to the audience observer, the hookup between these two young folks, despite its maladroitness, might even have the makings of a relationship, were circumstances different. Unfortunately for Tom, the current circumstances include his having misread this latest conquest, an insecure woman who confesses to us her apprehensions about sex in general, and reveals that her drinking and partying are less a natural predilection than a response to pressure from her more sophisticated friend Heather (who gifts Amber with her own personal flask). Moreover, her hours of practice on the university squash team in tandem with her bar activities preclude any time for study, another thing that makes her nervous and uncomfortable in these first months away from home. But one thing she knows for sure is that she’s attracted to Tom. And she feels very bad to see him “alone” and without support, answering the questions of the prying panel. This network of psychological nuance and the abundant detail Ziegler adds to her back story makes for a top-notch narrative that travels beyond the hot-button issue of date rape it tackles. The characters, Amber especially, are as finely etched as in a good novel, and as satisfying. Under Tyne Rafaeli’s direction, Ressler’s portrayal conjures a confused and maddeningly myopic young woman you alternately want to shake for her waffling ambivalence (she never actually says “no”) and comfort for her overwhelming anxiety. MacKinnon starts out a bit too much of a cypher but his performance visibly deepens as the web tightens around his character. Designer Tim Mackabee’s set resembles a textured wooden box that lighting designer Lap Chi Chu floods at certain junctures with varying hues of light. Pretty in places, I found it static, and wished for more lighting to be focused on the performers, when they rose from their seats, or when the story changed or shifted from past to present. By contrast, Vincent Olivieri sound design added notably to an uneasy ambience.","locationName":"Geffen Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/actually-go-8265869","date":"June 2","type":"Theater","address":"10886 Le Conte Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024 310-208-5454"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

Regis and Kathie Lee they are not, but what role do they play, exactly? They seem at least to be parodying on-screen consumerism and polish while acknowledging the sincerity of the desire for more, less or whatever.","locationName":"California African American Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/derrick-adams-network-8121979","date":"June 2","type":"Art Museums","address":"600 State Drive, Exposition Park Los Angeles, CA 90037 213-629-2787"},{"name":"Dwan Gallery Exhibition Image Los Angeles to New York:...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The largest crate that ever came into LACMA’s galleries held Robert Grosvenor's sculpture Untitled (yellow), or so said curator Stephanie Barron a few nights ago at a preview of \"Los Angeles to New York: Dwan Gallery, 1959-1971.\" Grosvenor’s sculpture, a futuristic abstraction in bright-yellow aluminum, hangs from the ceiling and juts across the space without ever touching the ground. Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 2","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Los Alamos Rolodex: Doing Business With the National Lab...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Edward Grothus used to work as a technician at the Los Alamos National Lab, which worked on the atomic bomb. But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 2","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art?

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 2","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

The Swedish-born musician initially broke through as a teenage prodigy with early-’80s L.A. metal band Alcatrazz. Malmsteen’s guitar-hero status emerged with his Rising Force project in the years that followed. His neoclassical shred-guitar compositions took center stage and influenced a wave of musicians welding metallic loudness with over-the-top technicality, which continues to this day with modern acts such as L.A.’s own Exmortus. Malmsteen has at times become shorthand in metal circles for guitar excess, but when it’s as shamelessly bombastic as this, it’s all good.","locationName":"Saban Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/yngwie-malmsteen-7943081","date":"June 2","type":"Metal Rock","address":"8440 W.

Wang can take a quaintly traditional piece such as Mozart's \"Turkish March\" and infuse it with madcap bursts of jazz, barrelhouse piano and febrile allusions to other composers.

Is he propelled by his own volition or are there other, more sinister individuals or forces pulling the strings? Think of the training camps of ISIS or al-Qaida or portraits of suicide bombers, teenagers prepared to sacrifice their lives to destroy the lives of others, for a cause. Where do they come from and what brought them to this radical point? Loosely based on historical fact, Rajiv Joseph’s droll and penetrating Archduke takes place in Serbia in 1914, and opens in the months prior to the assassination of Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie — an act that precipitated World War I and changed the world forever. The spine of the play is the relationship between three of the youths recruited to carry out the murder (there actually were seven), and the fanatical military officer, Dragutin Dimitrijevic (Patrick Page), who indoctrinates them. While the details are fictional, the characters, including Dimitrijevic, are based on real personages: Gavrilo Princip (Stephen Stocking) who ultimately fired the fatal shots; Nedeljko Cabrinovic (Josiah Bania), who threw a bomb that missed; and a third co-conspirator and friend, Trifko Grabež (Ramiz Monsef) — in this telling of the story, the most together of the three. All three suffered from tuberculosis, and Joseph’s play begins in the examining room of a doctor (Todd Weeks) who tells Gavrilo that he’s ill and has less than a year to live. The sensitive and unworldly Gavrilo is slow to digest the news, and instead chooses to obsess over blood on the doctor’s handkerchief (his own), and the gender of the examining room skeleton (female), which offends his sensibilities as one respectful of the opposite sex. Later, the good doctor is visited by Colonel Dimitrijevic who requests that the physician send him five of his patients to be drafted into service. When the doctor refuses, he’s bullied and threatened with his life until he buckles and complies. There follows an entertaining scene among the three unsuspecting recruits — innocents, basically, who’ve never been with a woman and for whom a hot sandwich is as close to the good life as they hope to get. They’re prime fodder for Page’s incendiary Colonel, a crafty true believer who tempts them with promises of food and a free train ride, while singing the praises of martyrdom and handing each a vial of cyanide. Though broadly framed by historical events, Archduke easily transcends these particulars; its coruscating depiction of the manipulation of the unschooled by a predatory monomaniac is an unhappily timeless (not to mention excruciatingly relevant) phenomenon, and marks it as a play of considerable substance. Plus, Joseph’s characters are drawn with accomplished depth beyond their service to the plot. The production, however, while strong in many places, is weak in others. Under Giovanna Sardelli’s direction, Page proves electrifying as a ruthless (and misogynistic) zealot driven by crazed macho fantasies, while Monsef, who looks first to be the Colonel’s henchman but turns out to be just another gullible kid, is on point from first to last. Unfortunately, both Bania as the slow-witted Nedeljko and Stocking as the pivotal Gavrilo — a 19-year-old whose quest for meaning in his life ultimately rubs up against his will to survive — deliver serviceable performances only, and the show falls short of what it could be. Also, while Tim Mackabee’s scenic design unfolds cleverly in the second half, the action at the top plays out against a drab backdrop with the faces of the performers poorly lit in the design conceived by Lap Chi Chu. While it’s true these characters dwell in grim surroundings, they and the audience deserve more illumination.","locationName":"Mark Taper Forum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archduke-go-8221678","date":"June 3","type":"Theater","address":"135 N.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 3","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"It is obvious from the map","summary":"By Catherine Wagley One refugee had no trouble getting from Damascus to Turkey according to a hand-drawn map hanging in REDCAT’s current exhibition, “It is obvious from the map.” But police caused big problems on the trip from Turkey to Greece, and then different police forces beat the travelers as they tried to get from Macedonia to Serbia.

Is he propelled by his own volition or are there other, more sinister individuals or forces pulling the strings? Think of the training camps of ISIS or al-Qaida or portraits of suicide bombers, teenagers prepared to sacrifice their lives to destroy the lives of others, for a cause. Where do they come from and what brought them to this radical point? Loosely based on historical fact, Rajiv Joseph’s droll and penetrating Archduke takes place in Serbia in 1914, and opens in the months prior to the assassination of Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie — an act that precipitated World War I and changed the world forever. The spine of the play is the relationship between three of the youths recruited to carry out the murder (there actually were seven), and the fanatical military officer, Dragutin Dimitrijevic (Patrick Page), who indoctrinates them. While the details are fictional, the characters, including Dimitrijevic, are based on real personages: Gavrilo Princip (Stephen Stocking) who ultimately fired the fatal shots; Nedeljko Cabrinovic (Josiah Bania), who threw a bomb that missed; and a third co-conspirator and friend, Trifko Grabež (Ramiz Monsef) — in this telling of the story, the most together of the three. All three suffered from tuberculosis, and Joseph’s play begins in the examining room of a doctor (Todd Weeks) who tells Gavrilo that he’s ill and has less than a year to live. The sensitive and unworldly Gavrilo is slow to digest the news, and instead chooses to obsess over blood on the doctor’s handkerchief (his own), and the gender of the examining room skeleton (female), which offends his sensibilities as one respectful of the opposite sex. Later, the good doctor is visited by Colonel Dimitrijevic who requests that the physician send him five of his patients to be drafted into service. When the doctor refuses, he’s bullied and threatened with his life until he buckles and complies. There follows an entertaining scene among the three unsuspecting recruits — innocents, basically, who’ve never been with a woman and for whom a hot sandwich is as close to the good life as they hope to get. They’re prime fodder for Page’s incendiary Colonel, a crafty true believer who tempts them with promises of food and a free train ride, while singing the praises of martyrdom and handing each a vial of cyanide. Though broadly framed by historical events, Archduke easily transcends these particulars; its coruscating depiction of the manipulation of the unschooled by a predatory monomaniac is an unhappily timeless (not to mention excruciatingly relevant) phenomenon, and marks it as a play of considerable substance. Plus, Joseph’s characters are drawn with accomplished depth beyond their service to the plot. The production, however, while strong in many places, is weak in others. Under Giovanna Sardelli’s direction, Page proves electrifying as a ruthless (and misogynistic) zealot driven by crazed macho fantasies, while Monsef, who looks first to be the Colonel’s henchman but turns out to be just another gullible kid, is on point from first to last. Unfortunately, both Bania as the slow-witted Nedeljko and Stocking as the pivotal Gavrilo — a 19-year-old whose quest for meaning in his life ultimately rubs up against his will to survive — deliver serviceable performances only, and the show falls short of what it could be. Also, while Tim Mackabee’s scenic design unfolds cleverly in the second half, the action at the top plays out against a drab backdrop with the faces of the performers poorly lit in the design conceived by Lap Chi Chu. While it’s true these characters dwell in grim surroundings, they and the audience deserve more illumination.","locationName":"Mark Taper Forum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archduke-go-8221678","date":"June 4","type":"Theater","address":"135 N.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega.

Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Simple and immediately legible despite halting English, they tell dramatic, sometimes violent stories in short hand. Co-curated by Thomas Keenan and Sohrab Mohebbi, the show uses maps to explore and trace recent and ongoing migration between the Middle East, Africa and Europe.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 4","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Roni Shneior: A Place in the Sun","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Roni Shneior’s sculpture Bloom is a tangle of ten arms with no body, only knots in the middle where they more or less meet.

Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 4","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Tomorrow!

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C.

For a second time at UCB, Torres hosts Julio Torres: My Favorite Shapes. In it, Torres sits at a table and plays with knickknacks and other small-scale objects of various shapes: squares, triangles, spheres. Torres tells funny stories inspired by the shapes — some that remind him of celebrities, including Ivanka Trump, Tilda Swinton and Eddie Redmayne — while he projects the entire performance on a screen.

For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence. All of these realities bleed together and coexist on the same intense, sensation-filled plane.","locationName":"Museum of Contemporary Art (The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-8097791","date":"June 5","type":"Art Galleries","address":"152 N. Central Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90012 213-626-6222"},{"name":"Archipelago","summary":"By Bill Raden Among the subtitles to Archipelago, Caridad Svich’s hauntingly enigmatic hallucination of a love story that is currently receiving its American premiere by Son of Semele Ensemble, are labels like “a memory play” and “a play on memory,” as well as “a dream of life.” These are all helpful to know before settling into a 2016 drama that is disorientingly stripped of the kind of reassuring external signposts that have accompanied romantic tragedy since Romeo and Juliet. It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 5","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Dwan Gallery Exhibition Image Los Angeles to New York:...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The largest crate that ever came into LACMA’s galleries held Robert Grosvenor's sculpture Untitled (yellow), or so said curator Stephanie Barron a few nights ago at a preview of \"Los Angeles to New York: Dwan Gallery, 1959-1971.\" Grosvenor’s sculpture, a futuristic abstraction in bright-yellow aluminum, hangs from the ceiling and juts across the space without ever touching the ground. Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 5","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 5","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

After the unequivocally heterosexual Tom tells Sunil to back off, the two men never mention it again, and they resume their friendship as before. How different, observes Tom, from his experience with women, who are “incapable of moving on even if you make out once for five minutes on a fucking dance floor.” As portrayed by MacKinnon, Tom is an attractive guy who scores lots of casual sex but is otherwise not especially worldly or predatory. Instead, he’s a lower-middle-class African-American kid who plays classical piano and has painstakingly made his way into the Ivy League. But now his future is threatened; a female freshman, a Jewish coed named Amber (Samantha Ressler), has accused him of rape, and he’s been called upon to face a three-person panel who will determine how much truth her statement holds. If her word is taken over his, Tom’s future may be toast. To Tom, his predicament is bewildering; he’d been under the impression that Amber liked him and wanted to be intimate, moreover, he’d liked her as well, despite her awkward manner and sometimes tactless remarks, such as assuming he got into Princeton because he was black. In fact, to the audience observer, the hookup between these two young folks, despite its maladroitness, might even have the makings of a relationship, were circumstances different. Unfortunately for Tom, the current circumstances include his having misread this latest conquest, an insecure woman who confesses to us her apprehensions about sex in general, and reveals that her drinking and partying are less a natural predilection than a response to pressure from her more sophisticated friend Heather (who gifts Amber with her own personal flask). Moreover, her hours of practice on the university squash team in tandem with her bar activities preclude any time for study, another thing that makes her nervous and uncomfortable in these first months away from home. But one thing she knows for sure is that she’s attracted to Tom. And she feels very bad to see him “alone” and without support, answering the questions of the prying panel. This network of psychological nuance and the abundant detail Ziegler adds to her back story makes for a top-notch narrative that travels beyond the hot-button issue of date rape it tackles. The characters, Amber especially, are as finely etched as in a good novel, and as satisfying. Under Tyne Rafaeli’s direction, Ressler’s portrayal conjures a confused and maddeningly myopic young woman you alternately want to shake for her waffling ambivalence (she never actually says “no”) and comfort for her overwhelming anxiety. MacKinnon starts out a bit too much of a cypher but his performance visibly deepens as the web tightens around his character. Designer Tim Mackabee’s set resembles a textured wooden box that lighting designer Lap Chi Chu floods at certain junctures with varying hues of light. Pretty in places, I found it static, and wished for more lighting to be focused on the performers, when they rose from their seats, or when the story changed or shifted from past to present. By contrast, Vincent Olivieri sound design added notably to an uneasy ambience.","locationName":"Geffen Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/actually-go-8265869","date":"June 6","type":"Theater","address":"10886 Le Conte Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024 310-208-5454"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

The intention of this evening is to bring together a diverse group of heart-centered women from all around LA for a night of inspired community. We are capping this event at 22 women to offer intimacy and an opportunity to genuinely connect with other women. This event includes a three course all-inclusive dinner, gifts {valued at over $200}, entertainment, and our iconic un-networking experience. GET YOUR TICKETS HERE: https://juneamplifydines.eventbrite.com/ NOTE: Amplify Dines tickets tend to sell out quickly. If you’re interested in joining, make sure purchase your tickets quickly! “Un-networking” is Amplify’s unique methodology that has been featured on KTLA, Forbes, and Medium where you are invited to build conversation and relationship based on who you are rather than what you do. This unusual approach has lead to hundreds of women building a lasting network of people they can rely on… instead of collecting a stack of business cards that goes neglected for months. Amplify has hosted over 30 sold out dinner parties in under two years, and in this time we have experienced first hand the level of impact that this event creates in the lives of every women who attended. Women walk away feel nourished both physically and emotionally, seen, heard, supported, inspired and confident in being supported by sisterhood.

Within ourselves and even within our own communities, I believe that we have the power to change the myths, preconceptions and inherited ideas surrounding sexual assault. We must educate ourselves and engage in thoughtful discourse, which this play so brilliantly concedes, in order to change the current culture” – Cathy Thomas-Grant; Director Set against the backdrop of the worldwide university campus sexual assault epidemic, THE INTERFERENCE follows one survivor’s struggle to make her story heard above all the noise. It explores the seemingly infinite outlets of opinion, commentary, and distorted or suppressed information that have become routine players in the aftermath of these incidents.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 6","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

The technical precision which is a hallmark of Mr. Chow's work, is even more apparent in these new works. \"I am thrilled to have the opportunity to launch this new series in Gallery 417,\" said Mr. Chow. \"The gallery, housed in the upscale Metro 417 building, provides the perfect environment to launch this series as it is both urban and modern in aesthetic. The clean lines of my work and the chic interior of the gallery complement each other well.\" The artist reception, where the entire body of work can be seen will be May 11 from 6-8 p.m. In addition to light refreshments, there will be an opportunity to meet the artist who will also be signing his limited edition books.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 6","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"TAG Gallery Reopening Show","summary":"This is TAG's first show at the new Museum Row location. \"TAG Gallery Reopening Show\" features Photography by Donn Delson, Bone Sculpture by Jerry Hardin, Mixed Media by Gary Polonsky, and Neon Sculptures by Linda Sue Price.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

After the unequivocally heterosexual Tom tells Sunil to back off, the two men never mention it again, and they resume their friendship as before. How different, observes Tom, from his experience with women, who are “incapable of moving on even if you make out once for five minutes on a fucking dance floor.” As portrayed by MacKinnon, Tom is an attractive guy who scores lots of casual sex but is otherwise not especially worldly or predatory. Instead, he’s a lower-middle-class African-American kid who plays classical piano and has painstakingly made his way into the Ivy League. But now his future is threatened; a female freshman, a Jewish coed named Amber (Samantha Ressler), has accused him of rape, and he’s been called upon to face a three-person panel who will determine how much truth her statement holds. If her word is taken over his, Tom’s future may be toast. To Tom, his predicament is bewildering; he’d been under the impression that Amber liked him and wanted to be intimate, moreover, he’d liked her as well, despite her awkward manner and sometimes tactless remarks, such as assuming he got into Princeton because he was black. In fact, to the audience observer, the hookup between these two young folks, despite its maladroitness, might even have the makings of a relationship, were circumstances different. Unfortunately for Tom, the current circumstances include his having misread this latest conquest, an insecure woman who confesses to us her apprehensions about sex in general, and reveals that her drinking and partying are less a natural predilection than a response to pressure from her more sophisticated friend Heather (who gifts Amber with her own personal flask). Moreover, her hours of practice on the university squash team in tandem with her bar activities preclude any time for study, another thing that makes her nervous and uncomfortable in these first months away from home. But one thing she knows for sure is that she’s attracted to Tom. And she feels very bad to see him “alone” and without support, answering the questions of the prying panel. This network of psychological nuance and the abundant detail Ziegler adds to her back story makes for a top-notch narrative that travels beyond the hot-button issue of date rape it tackles. The characters, Amber especially, are as finely etched as in a good novel, and as satisfying. Under Tyne Rafaeli’s direction, Ressler’s portrayal conjures a confused and maddeningly myopic young woman you alternately want to shake for her waffling ambivalence (she never actually says “no”) and comfort for her overwhelming anxiety. MacKinnon starts out a bit too much of a cypher but his performance visibly deepens as the web tightens around his character. Designer Tim Mackabee’s set resembles a textured wooden box that lighting designer Lap Chi Chu floods at certain junctures with varying hues of light. Pretty in places, I found it static, and wished for more lighting to be focused on the performers, when they rose from their seats, or when the story changed or shifted from past to present. By contrast, Vincent Olivieri sound design added notably to an uneasy ambience.","locationName":"Geffen Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/actually-go-8265869","date":"June 7","type":"Theater","address":"10886 Le Conte Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024 310-208-5454"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

A big, fake TV screen made of fabric squares and plastic hangs on the wall behind her. Several actors peddle cardboard boxes in On, pitching their products as if on a morning show or infomercial. They're enthusiastic if confusing. A girl-guy team peddles \"More for Less\" by saying it's just nice sometimes to have more, especially when it's for less. Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 7","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Within ourselves and even within our own communities, I believe that we have the power to change the myths, preconceptions and inherited ideas surrounding sexual assault. We must educate ourselves and engage in thoughtful discourse, which this play so brilliantly concedes, in order to change the current culture” – Cathy Thomas-Grant; Director Set against the backdrop of the worldwide university campus sexual assault epidemic, THE INTERFERENCE follows one survivor’s struggle to make her story heard above all the noise.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 7","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Christopher Orr: The Inmost Light","summary":"Certain paintings in Christopher Orr’s show at Ibid., \"The Inmost Light,\" recall scenes from HBO’s The Leftovers.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 7","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 7","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Like Persian miniatures, Bustamante’s paintings are elaborate and enticing. Flowers from Mars combines carefully painted human-interpreted flora with otherworldly environments. The environments are constructed with washes of gouache and acrylic paint to create ethereal and atmospheric settings, where microscopic gardens float and flourish. Laurel finds abstraction to be more poetic in expressing nature than realism. Researching botanical motifs found in history is an important part of her process. By combining and contrasting highly rendered flora within atmospheric and abstract settings, she is exploring the schism in the human brain between our delight in nature and our global inability to maintain it. Each painting develops organically without a predetermined plan. The contrast between vaporous washes and tiny brushwork is extreme and requires a slow, contemplative process. Laurel Bustamante received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Southern Oregon University, Summa Cum Laude. In 2013, she was the finalist for the Portland Art Museum Contemporary Northwest Art Awards, in Portland Oregon.

After the unequivocally heterosexual Tom tells Sunil to back off, the two men never mention it again, and they resume their friendship as before. How different, observes Tom, from his experience with women, who are “incapable of moving on even if you make out once for five minutes on a fucking dance floor.” As portrayed by MacKinnon, Tom is an attractive guy who scores lots of casual sex but is otherwise not especially worldly or predatory. Instead, he’s a lower-middle-class African-American kid who plays classical piano and has painstakingly made his way into the Ivy League. But now his future is threatened; a female freshman, a Jewish coed named Amber (Samantha Ressler), has accused him of rape, and he’s been called upon to face a three-person panel who will determine how much truth her statement holds. If her word is taken over his, Tom’s future may be toast. To Tom, his predicament is bewildering; he’d been under the impression that Amber liked him and wanted to be intimate, moreover, he’d liked her as well, despite her awkward manner and sometimes tactless remarks, such as assuming he got into Princeton because he was black. In fact, to the audience observer, the hookup between these two young folks, despite its maladroitness, might even have the makings of a relationship, were circumstances different. Unfortunately for Tom, the current circumstances include his having misread this latest conquest, an insecure woman who confesses to us her apprehensions about sex in general, and reveals that her drinking and partying are less a natural predilection than a response to pressure from her more sophisticated friend Heather (who gifts Amber with her own personal flask). Moreover, her hours of practice on the university squash team in tandem with her bar activities preclude any time for study, another thing that makes her nervous and uncomfortable in these first months away from home. But one thing she knows for sure is that she’s attracted to Tom. And she feels very bad to see him “alone” and without support, answering the questions of the prying panel. This network of psychological nuance and the abundant detail Ziegler adds to her back story makes for a top-notch narrative that travels beyond the hot-button issue of date rape it tackles. The characters, Amber especially, are as finely etched as in a good novel, and as satisfying. Under Tyne Rafaeli’s direction, Ressler’s portrayal conjures a confused and maddeningly myopic young woman you alternately want to shake for her waffling ambivalence (she never actually says “no”) and comfort for her overwhelming anxiety. MacKinnon starts out a bit too much of a cypher but his performance visibly deepens as the web tightens around his character. Designer Tim Mackabee’s set resembles a textured wooden box that lighting designer Lap Chi Chu floods at certain junctures with varying hues of light. Pretty in places, I found it static, and wished for more lighting to be focused on the performers, when they rose from their seats, or when the story changed or shifted from past to present. By contrast, Vincent Olivieri sound design added notably to an uneasy ambience.","locationName":"Geffen Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/actually-go-8265869","date":"June 8","type":"Theater","address":"10886 Le Conte Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024 310-208-5454"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 8","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

You may recognize \"Convoy's\" trio of performers as the ingeniously helpful losers Swift, Blodget and Gunt from FX's short-lived Terriers.

The legendary pedal steel guitarist, who replaced Tom Brumley in Buck Owens’ Buckaroos circa ’69, is an incomparable musician with impeccable taste and an impressive trove of stellar credits. Maness’ warm, expressive style — always complementary, never overplayed — made him an in-demand sideman, and he has recorded with everyone from Gram Parsons and The Byrds to Charlie Rich and Waylon Jennings.

Within ourselves and even within our own communities, I believe that we have the power to change the myths, preconceptions and inherited ideas surrounding sexual assault. We must educate ourselves and engage in thoughtful discourse, which this play so brilliantly concedes, in order to change the current culture” – Cathy Thomas-Grant; Director Set against the backdrop of the worldwide university campus sexual assault epidemic, THE INTERFERENCE follows one survivor’s struggle to make her story heard above all the noise. It explores the seemingly infinite outlets of opinion, commentary, and distorted or suppressed information that have become routine players in the aftermath of these incidents.

The series spotlights sustainability – from agriculture to food and wine production to wildlife conservation – and each evening focuses on a different topic and features conversations with a curator or keeper, up-close animal encounters, and wine introductions by representatives from a local winery or vineyard that shares the Zoo’s commitment to sustainable living. Guests enjoy a seasonally inspired, five-course, farm-to-table dinner created by the Zoo’s executive chef, Brad Robertson, where each course is paired with wines from the evening's featured winery. Limited to 50 guests per dinner, the intimate evenings are open to guests ages 21 and older. The Thursday, April 27 Sustainable Wine+Dinner evening, themed \"Happy Trails,\" is set on the terraces of the L.A. Zoo's Mahale Mountains and features Los Angeles' own Malibu Family Wines. The Santa Monica Mountains, home to Malibu Wines’ Saddlerock Ranch, is also an important wildlife habitat. Griffith Park’s celebrity mountain lion, P-22, originated in the Santa Monica Mountains, and his story has brought much attention to the issues of habitat fragmentation and wildlife corridors. Guests at the evening enjoy wines of this biodiverse region while learning about the importance of protected migration paths for its native wildlife from conservation biologist and wildlife ecologist Anthony J. Giordano, founder and director of S.P.E.C.I.E.S., The Society for the Conservation of Endangered Carnivores. The \"Happy Trails\" menu begins with popcorn shrimp ceviche, gorgonzola dulce arancini, and chilled breakfast radishes with prosciutto butter, paired with 2015 Semler Rose. Next, guests are served a tomato tart with pea shoots, basil, smoky eggplant and yogurt alongside 2015 Saddlerock Sauvignon Blanc. The main courses include duck breast with beets, spring onions, fennel purree and honey gastrique, paired with 2014 Semler King of the Mountains Cuvee, and braised beef cheek with confit potatoes, watercress and melted cippolinis, paired with 2013 Semler Malbec.

Zoo's Rainforest of the Americas on Thursday, May 11, features Temecula's Palumbo Family Vineyards and Winery. One of the Palumbo Family Vineyards’ many commitments to sustainability is its use of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices. This strategy involves creating conditions that promote beneficial microbes, insects, and other organisms to reduce the need for conventional chemical pest and weed control. An important part of IPM is the presence of raptors such as owls and hawks that naturally control rodents.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 8","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 9","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Actually — GO!","summary":"By Deborah Klugman In Anna Ziegler’s smart and penetrating play Actually, now premiering at the Geffen Playhouse, Tom (Jerry MacKinnon), a freshman at Princeton, recounts an incident in which his best buddy Sunil leans in and kisses him on the mouth. After the unequivocally heterosexual Tom tells Sunil to back off, the two men never mention it again, and they resume their friendship as before. How different, observes Tom, from his experience with women, who are “incapable of moving on even if you make out once for five minutes on a fucking dance floor.” As portrayed by MacKinnon, Tom is an attractive guy who scores lots of casual sex but is otherwise not especially worldly or predatory. Instead, he’s a lower-middle-class African-American kid who plays classical piano and has painstakingly made his way into the Ivy League. But now his future is threatened; a female freshman, a Jewish coed named Amber (Samantha Ressler), has accused him of rape, and he’s been called upon to face a three-person panel who will determine how much truth her statement holds. If her word is taken over his, Tom’s future may be toast. To Tom, his predicament is bewildering; he’d been under the impression that Amber liked him and wanted to be intimate, moreover, he’d liked her as well, despite her awkward manner and sometimes tactless remarks, such as assuming he got into Princeton because he was black. In fact, to the audience observer, the hookup between these two young folks, despite its maladroitness, might even have the makings of a relationship, were circumstances different. Unfortunately for Tom, the current circumstances include his having misread this latest conquest, an insecure woman who confesses to us her apprehensions about sex in general, and reveals that her drinking and partying are less a natural predilection than a response to pressure from her more sophisticated friend Heather (who gifts Amber with her own personal flask). Moreover, her hours of practice on the university squash team in tandem with her bar activities preclude any time for study, another thing that makes her nervous and uncomfortable in these first months away from home. But one thing she knows for sure is that she’s attracted to Tom. And she feels very bad to see him “alone” and without support, answering the questions of the prying panel. This network of psychological nuance and the abundant detail Ziegler adds to her back story makes for a top-notch narrative that travels beyond the hot-button issue of date rape it tackles. The characters, Amber especially, are as finely etched as in a good novel, and as satisfying. Under Tyne Rafaeli’s direction, Ressler’s portrayal conjures a confused and maddeningly myopic young woman you alternately want to shake for her waffling ambivalence (she never actually says “no”) and comfort for her overwhelming anxiety. MacKinnon starts out a bit too much of a cypher but his performance visibly deepens as the web tightens around his character. Designer Tim Mackabee’s set resembles a textured wooden box that lighting designer Lap Chi Chu floods at certain junctures with varying hues of light. Pretty in places, I found it static, and wished for more lighting to be focused on the performers, when they rose from their seats, or when the story changed or shifted from past to present. By contrast, Vincent Olivieri sound design added notably to an uneasy ambience.","locationName":"Geffen Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/actually-go-8265869","date":"June 9","type":"Theater","address":"10886 Le Conte Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024 310-208-5454"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

The collaboration brings out the best in both artists, who merge their distinctive voices, personalities and guitar styles to create vibrant, immediate music that's firmly rooted in tradition yet ruled by a restless, spirited sense of adventure. \"We wanted to do a real good record together, but we didn't want to do the record that everyone expected us to do,\" blues legend Taj Mahal says of TajMo, his historic collaboration with fellow true believer Keb' Mo'. \"There wasn't a bunch of cryin' and ringin' hands, we just got together and it came together pretty naturally. I think it's a pretty upbeat, celebratory record, and it couldn't have come at a better time.\" The iconoclastic pair's combustible creative chemistry powers such unforgettable new originals as \"Don't Leave Me Here,\" \"All Around The World,\" \"That's Who I Am,\" and the anthemic \"Soul.\" TajMo also features guest appearances by Sheila E., Lizz Wright and Bonnie Raitt, who lends her voice to a memorable cover of John Mayer's \"Waiting On The World To Change\"; in addition, Joe Walsh adds his trademark guitar work to \"Shake Me In Your Arms\" and an inspired reading of The Who's classic \"Squeeze Box.\" The GRAMMY Museum is pleased to welcome multiple GRAMMY winners Taj Mahal and Keb' Mo' to the Clive Davis Theater for an intimate discussion on both of their distinguished careers and their new collaboration record TajMo, followed by a special performance.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 9","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Christopher Orr: The Inmost Light","summary":"Certain paintings in Christopher Orr’s show at Ibid., \"The Inmost Light,\" recall scenes from HBO’s The Leftovers.

Olympic Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90015 213-765-6800"},{"name":"Archipelago","summary":"By Bill Raden Among the subtitles to Archipelago, Caridad Svich’s hauntingly enigmatic hallucination of a love story that is currently receiving its American premiere by Son of Semele Ensemble, are labels like “a memory play” and “a play on memory,” as well as “a dream of life.” These are all helpful to know before settling into a 2016 drama that is disorientingly stripped of the kind of reassuring external signposts that have accompanied romantic tragedy since Romeo and Juliet. It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 10","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Arthur Jafa: Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death","summary":"By Catherine Wagley “I knew something was wrong when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man’s arms,” Charles Ramsey told a Cleveland reporter after he rescued longtime hostage Amanda Berry. “Something is wrong here.” The clip of Ramsey saying this is the first thing you see in Arthur Jafa’s video collage Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death, now playing on a loop in a dark gallery at MOCA’s Geffen Contemporary. For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence. All of these realities bleed together and coexist on the same intense, sensation-filled plane.","locationName":"Museum of Contemporary Art (The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-8097791","date":"June 10","type":"Art Galleries","address":"152 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 10","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Derrick Adams: \"Network\"","summary":"By Catherine Wagley \"Colorful has taught them that they don't need a man,\" an actress says in artist Derrick Adams' short film On. \"They need Colorful.\" The actress holds a cardboard box with the word \"Colorful\" collaged onto it, and stands on a comically DIY set. A big, fake TV screen made of fabric squares and plastic hangs on the wall behind her. Several actors peddle cardboard boxes in On, pitching their products as if on a morning show or infomercial. They're enthusiastic if confusing. A girl-guy team peddles \"More for Less\" by saying it's just nice sometimes to have more, especially when it's for less. Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 10","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"International Printing Museum","summary":"By Eve Weston Letterpress printing is enjoying a revival, and the International Printing Museum is Mecca for this retro art, boasting the Ernest A.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Many people who have iPods, Androids, tablets, iPhones, and other gadgets, can’t figure out all of the features. The young volunteers are familiar with many of the concepts behind these devices, so even if they haven’t used a particular gadget, they may be able to help a person figure out what to do. This program was initiated by San Marino High School student Chunbill “Billy” Liu who grew up surrounded by gadgets, but noticed there was a technology gap with people who did not have that advantage. Billy approached Crowell Library about closing this gap, while getting in some community services hours for himself and his friends, but the program has continued because there is such a need. Now volunteers from National Charity League have stepped in to help the tech-needy! If you are frustrated with online and telephone support options, come to Crowell Library and work with a living, breathing techie that will help you “bond” with your device. There’s nothing like one-on-one assistance to help solve problems and tackle sticky widgets. Registration is required for this program. To reserve your spot, please call 626-300-0777, extension 579 as soon as possible.

Each with a language of its own when perception gets a hold on our soul, and we can’t look away from what they demand of us. Art has a way of saving “things” from extinction, even if it’s just a simple, easy, depth of a new color, sound, distraction from—there is nothing so compelling when it comes to an artistic view. Exhibition Dates are June 3 thru July 5, 2017 Gallery A: Lillian Abel, “Energy” “Energy” My work depicts Nature, however, it is made in my studio from memory, impulse and emotions. Lillian Abel is a Los Angeles based artist who creates paintings that provoke a response to the unknown. Gallery B: Tracey Weiss, “Metamorphosis” “Metamorphosis” is an investigation into the innate cycle of nature, as well as our own society. Tracey Weiss is a Long Beach based artist who creates sculpture from found objects, as well as ceramics. Gallery C: Karrie Ross, “Balance & Flow” “Balance & Flow” continues the questions for how exposure to higher vibrations, deep thinking, and taking actions are able to twist perception and create the ability to make conscious choices affecting growth on the cellular level. Karrie Ross is a Los Angeles based visual artist, who offers choices, and a sense of ‘safe’ through paintings, and interactive installations, allowing a twisting of perceptions using kinetic-ly infused visual experiences. *** The Mike Kelley Gallery is part of historic Beyond Baroque, one of the United States’ leading independent Literary / Arts Centers and public spaces dedicated to expanding the public’s knowledge of art, poetry, and literature through cultural events and community interaction.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 11","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Arthur Jafa: Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death","summary":"By Catherine Wagley “I knew something was wrong when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man’s arms,” Charles Ramsey told a Cleveland reporter after he rescued longtime hostage Amanda Berry. “Something is wrong here.” The clip of Ramsey saying this is the first thing you see in Arthur Jafa’s video collage Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death, now playing on a loop in a dark gallery at MOCA’s Geffen Contemporary.

Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"June 11","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","address":"601 S.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"June 11","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"ASSSSCAT","summary":"By Zachary Pincus-Roth UCB's flagship improv night featuring a rotating cast of UCB greats, such as Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Matt Walsh, Sean Conroy, Lauren Lapkus, Joe Wengert and Zach Woods, plus special guest improvisers and monologist.

The central component of this project is a 33-foot mural designed by renowned Los Angeles artist Fabian Debora and completed by people from across Los Angeles County. Debora’s own life includes trauma, domestic violence, gang membership, incarceration and addiction. It also includes art as a grounding tool, self-defining passion, source of confidence and place of belonging. “What was effective in my recovery, my transformation, was to be able to get to the core,” says Debora when describing the project concept. “To embrace it, not be in shame of it, but be able to get to the truth of who I am.” Debora shared art as this resource for transformation with 11 AWBW partner organizations as they created their own mural panels, including Homeboy Industries where he is Director of Substance Abuse Services and Programming. The other ten participating organizations are Alternatives Behavioral Health, Center for the Pacific-Asian Family, Domestic Violence Center of Santa Clarita Valley, Helping Hands Resource Center, Juntos: Lennox School & Community Wellness, Korean American Family Services, Los Angeles Unified School District, Rainbow Services, Richstone Family Center and United American Indian Involvement. AWBW has been partnering with human service organizations for 25 years to provide art as a resource for healing. Art is a way for individuals to reclaim their voices and true identities, to find a place of inclusion, and to begin a personal transformation that will ripple out into their families and communities. The “At the Core” interactive exhibition, supported by LA County Arts Commission and the Department of Cultural Affairs, will be on display through June 24. Exhibition attendees are invited to participate in this project through both creating personal art and contributing to community art pieces.","locationName":"Emily Anne Evans","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/at-the-core-transforming-trauma-together-opening-reception-8221654","date":"June 11","type":"Arts & Culture Community Events Free Events","address":"18312 Oxnard St. Tarzana, CA 91356 818-697-5525"},{"name":"Taste of the Nation","summary":"Promotional Event Description Taste of the Nation Los Angeles’ Taste of the Nation for No Kid Hungry returns to Media Park in Culver City where guests can enjoy some of the most celebrated food in the area on June 11, 2017.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 11","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help.

I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 11","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Olympic Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90015 213-765-6800"},{"name":"Archipelago","summary":"By Bill Raden Among the subtitles to Archipelago, Caridad Svich’s hauntingly enigmatic hallucination of a love story that is currently receiving its American premiere by Son of Semele Ensemble, are labels like “a memory play” and “a play on memory,” as well as “a dream of life.” These are all helpful to know before settling into a 2016 drama that is disorientingly stripped of the kind of reassuring external signposts that have accompanied romantic tragedy since Romeo and Juliet. It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 12","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Arthur Jafa: Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death","summary":"By Catherine Wagley “I knew something was wrong when a little pretty white girl ran into a black man’s arms,” Charles Ramsey told a Cleveland reporter after he rescued longtime hostage Amanda Berry. “Something is wrong here.” The clip of Ramsey saying this is the first thing you see in Arthur Jafa’s video collage Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death, now playing on a loop in a dark gallery at MOCA’s Geffen Contemporary.

Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 12","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

As such, he recruited some of the city's most respected players to write and record on it, including John Prine, Duane Eddy, Jerry Douglas, and Pat McLaughlin, along with Bobby Wood and Gene Chrisman of the Memphis Boys.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 13","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters","summary":"Celebrate the life and legacy of icon David Bowie in a special exhibition of exclusive images by Fernando Aceves of the late, legendary singer-songwriter taken during his historic 1997 Earthling album tour to Mexico City.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 13","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 14","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters","summary":"Celebrate the life and legacy of icon David Bowie in a special exhibition of exclusive images by Fernando Aceves of the late, legendary singer-songwriter taken during his historic 1997 Earthling album tour to Mexico City.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 14","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 14","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities.

In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"June 15","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","address":"601 S.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"June 15","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 15","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

The many, of course, are immigrants. The one is harder to imagine and realize. This three-word myth assumes an America that is open and secure, diverse and unified, and constantly changing and fundamentally stable. A symbol that is usually associated with this myth is the melting pot, which appears instructive on the surface until we begin to ask questions of it. Who is doing the melting, and what is the result? What is lost and what is gained in the melting? Is it language, culture, identity? Such questions are more pressing than ever as the myth of the immigrant nation undergoes unique challenges and revisions.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 15","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

The many, of course, are immigrants. The one is harder to imagine and realize. This three-word myth assumes an America that is open and secure, diverse and unified, and constantly changing and fundamentally stable. A symbol that is usually associated with this myth is the melting pot, which appears instructive on the surface until we begin to ask questions of it. Who is doing the melting, and what is the result? What is lost and what is gained in the melting? Is it language, culture, identity?

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 15","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Mystery Lit: Holmes, Sherlock and The Consulting Detective","summary":"Unbound Productions, creators of Wicked Lit, bring immersive mystery theatre to the Santa Anita Train Depot, on the grounds of Los Angeles County Arboretum MYSTERY LIT: Holmes, Sherlock and The Consulting Detective by Jonathan Josephson directed by Paul Millet a mash-up of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “A Scandal in Bohemia,” “The Red-Headed League,” and “The Adventure of the Copper Beeches” The games are afoot!

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 15","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 16","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Dwan Gallery Exhibition Image Los Angeles to New York:...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The largest crate that ever came into LACMA’s galleries held Robert Grosvenor's sculpture Untitled (yellow), or so said curator Stephanie Barron a few nights ago at a preview of \"Los Angeles to New York: Dwan Gallery, 1959-1971.\" Grosvenor’s sculpture, a futuristic abstraction in bright-yellow aluminum, hangs from the ceiling and juts across the space without ever touching the ground. Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 16","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 16","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"A Cinematic Centennial Celebration of the Russian...","summary":"The L.A.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 16","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 17","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Puccini's Madama Butterfly","summary":"Opera in three acts, Music by Giacomo Puccini.

Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 17","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week. Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"June 17","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","address":"601 S.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 17","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 17","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"June 17","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Salsa Night","summary":"","locationName":"El Floridita Restaurant","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/salsa-night-4290885","date":"June 17","type":"Music DJ Latin Salsa","address":"1253 N.

The performance whimsically weaves detailed dancing and poetic storytelling with an intricate live vocal and sound score. hOlie luna is heartbreakingly silly and vulnerable as it searches for a kind of connection that is not exclusive, dictatorial or fragmented, but rather a resource that is yours, mine, and ours: invisible but felt, gentle as the breath, and articulate like music. This original new work is conceived, written, and choreographed by Aurora Lagattuta in collaboration with music composition by Celeste Oram. hOlie luna is performed by vocalist, Lauren Jones, pianist, Mari Kawamura, and dancers, Ian Isles and Aurora Lagattuta. This work also features an art installation by Grace Mae Huddleston that will evoke simple yet poetic interactions with the audience prior to the dance performance. Aurora Lagattuta has choreographed and performed across The U.S., Europe, and Asia and is presently based in Southern California. Her work has been described as being, “bizarre and beautiful” as well as “transformational” and “otherworldly” by the Huffington Post. Lagattuta has been presented at Theatre Row in New York City, Electric Lodge in Los Angeles, Cindy Pritzker in Chicago, k77 in Berlin, The New Space in Brussels, La Caldera in Barcelona, Café de las Artes in Santander, and by Malashock, Vanguard Culture, and the Mingei Museum in San Diego. She has been awarded residencies at Bali Purnati in Bali, Indonesia, Palacio de Festivales and Forn de La Calc in Spain, Ponderosa in Germany and Shiro Oni in Japan. She danced for various companies in NYC, Portland, Germany, and Spain, most notably with Meg Stuart and Marta Carasco and she holds a B.A. in Theatre from Fordham University at Lincoln Center, NYC. Her solo, Inside the Whale, toured throughout Europe, Chicago, Los Angeles and at the United Solo Festival on Broadway in NYC, where she was awarded, The Best Multi-Media Solo Award and The United Solo Award. The United Solo Award hosted Lagattuta’s solo performance at the United Solo Europe Festival in Warsaw, Poland. She is an Academy Member for United Solo, a member of the New Space Collective in Belgium.

San Marino, CA 91108 626-405-2100"},{"name":"Archipelago","summary":"By Bill Raden Among the subtitles to Archipelago, Caridad Svich’s hauntingly enigmatic hallucination of a love story that is currently receiving its American premiere by Son of Semele Ensemble, are labels like “a memory play” and “a play on memory,” as well as “a dream of life.” These are all helpful to know before settling into a 2016 drama that is disorientingly stripped of the kind of reassuring external signposts that have accompanied romantic tragedy since Romeo and Juliet. It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 18","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 18","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 18","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico.

The Virgil feels perfect, big enough that there's a real energy to the room, but cozy enough that bigger acts can feel like they can come here and try out new stuff.\" For more see the rest of our article on the show: Hot Tub at the Virgil. 7 p.m. doors, 8 p.m. show.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"June 19","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"La Brea Tar Pits","summary":"The world's most famous ice age excavation site also includes the adjoining Page Museum.

Each quarter we will dedicate 3 full classes to a cross-section of beer and cheese. You can attend an individual class or purchase the package to save $10! If you're ready to level up your beer and cheese knowledge, join us as we venture into the beautiful world of Belgium! Unlike many cheese producing regions, Belgian culture focuses heavily on beer as opposed to wine. This series explores the beers and cheeses from this historically and culturally important region, developing a deep understanding of their relationship as it stands today. Each class is an interactive and social experience where discussion and debate are encouraged! 1. BELGIAN CHEESE - April 17 The first class in this series focuses on Belgian cheese. You will be provided a selection of Belgian cheeses paired with Angel City's beers to enjoy throughout the session. Alex, head curd nerd and owner of Vagabond Cheese, will discuss the history, production, and various styles of Belgian Cheese. 2. BELGIAN BEER - May 15 Certified Cicerones Keith and Dan from Angel City Brewery will take you through a history of Belgian brewing and how those historical styles developed in the Belgian ales we know and love! You will receive a flight of Belgian Ales paired with Vagabond's artisan cheese to enjoy throughout the class. 3. ALL-BELGIAN PAIRINGS - June 19 In the last session, we will take all the knowledge gained from our previous sessions and learn how to apply it to a pairing grid! The most interactive session of the series, you will create your own pairing exclusively featuring Belgian Cheeses and Belgian Ales with the guidance of Alex, Keith, and Dan! By the end of this session, you will know what makes a pairing tick so you can go forth and create pairings of your own! Like last time, we expect this event to sell out! Grab your tickets now!

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 19","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Organized into themed sections, the display spotlights the singer, songwriter, musician and two-time Hall of Famer's life and music, especially his partnership with Art Garfunkel in the 1950s and '60s and solo career, beginning in 1971, which produced the mega-selling 1986 album Graceland. Highlights include photographs, instruments, awards and costumes, as well as handwritten lyrics to \"Mrs. Robinson,\" \"Mother and Child Reunion\" and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\" and music sheets for \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\" The exhibit also offers an interactive music lab, featuring a communal drum circle and mixing equipment.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paul-simon-words-and-music-8121820","date":"June 20","type":"Museums Music","address":"2701 N.

Held over three days in June 1967 in Monterey, it was the first American rock festival and the breakout stage for Janis Joplin, Otis Redding and Ravi Shankar, as well as The Who and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, who, as the famous story goes, tossed a coin to see which would perform first. The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

Qutaish now lives with his family in a refugee camp in Turkey; a four-by-four-foot version of the 3-D model was first displayed in New York's Mmuseumm in 2016. Qutaish built his project using cardboard, glue, colored pencils and watercolors, and erected not only historic sites such as Aleppo's Citadel — a medieval, fortified palace that's considered one of the oldest landmarks in the world — but also restaurants, gardens, rooftop pools, solar panels and helicopter pads.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/future-aleppo-8215109","date":"June 20","type":"Art Museums","address":"2701 N.

The exhibit features (through May 21 only) two pages of the original document on loan from the National Archives, as well as the Presidential Proclamation 2537 signed on Jan. 14, 1942 that required aliens from Germany, Italy and Japan to register with the U.S. Department of Justice.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 20","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week. Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"June 20","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"June 20","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Victory Lap","summary":"By Jennifer Swann Victory Lap is a variety show, emphasis on the variety: There’s a traditional house band and stand-up comedians (Megan Koester, Brendon Small, Dan St. Germain) between sets, but then there are the weirder things: puppet surgery, tap dancing, busking. Even stranger is what takes place offstage: slow dancing, usually. That’s because at Victory Lap, there’s no separation between performers and audience members, and the latter can purchase raffle tickets for a chance to take the stage and spin a giant wheel that will lead to either humiliation or victory — often, one is the result of the other, and there are plenty of cool prizes as consolation. Tonight’s Halloween-themed shindig is hosted by Dracula (who looks a lot like Victory Lap co-host Seth W. Owen) and the wheel features more frightening challenges than usual. “If it lands on a séance, we’ll have a séance onstage,” producer Sharon Eisman says. “We’re a little nuts.

This month, we're meeting at Alo Yoga in Beverly Hills. This time, you have the option to join us an hour before the mixer (5-6pm) for a FREE yoga class taught by Amplify co-founder, Thais Sky! GET YOUR TICKETS HERE! https://amplifyjunemixer.eventbrite.com/ The traditional networking scene is often considered overwhelming and boring, with the predictable outcome of a collection of business cards and no real relationships and meaningful conversations. It was built as an integral part of the man’s club and not conducive to women’s psychology. Amplify is here to change all that. At The Amplify Co., we believe that it is women coming together that will change the world. But if we want to feel connected, empowered, and truly seen by one another, we have to do it our way. From that resolution, the “un-networking” methodology was born. “Un-networking” is Amplify’s unique methodology that has been featured on KTLA, Forbes, and Medium where you are invited to build conversation and relationship based on who you are rather than what you do. This unusual approach has lead to hundreds of women building a lasting network of people they can rely on… instead of collecting a stack of business cards that goes neglected for months. You can also watch the segment from KTLA where the founders share about the movement here: http://bit.ly/2qXYtwh Building relationships is key to a successful (and sustainable) life + business. People buy from those who they know and like, and opportunities rain on those who have a strong community. Hands down connecting with other people in an authentic way has the power to catalyze your growth. ----- This mixer will be hosted at Alo Yoga in Beverly Hills - the brand's Flagship store and studio. Alo believes in inspiring community, and thier stores {with airy cafes serving coffee, matcha, juice + more, thier beautiful yoga studios, and thier sun-drenched decks} are the embodiment of this philosophy. At The Amplify Mixer on June 20th, you can expect an opportunity to meet other high-caliber purpose-driven ladies in an intimate, relaxed, chic setting (no business card flinging included) that will leave you feeling inspired, activated and connected. Introverts and extroverts welcome. *** In addition, Amplify Co-founder Thais Sky will be teaching a FREE yoga class at Alo before the mixer! *** * Yoga with Thais will be from 5-6pm.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 20","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 21","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 21","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 21","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Qutaish now lives with his family in a refugee camp in Turkey; a four-by-four-foot version of the 3-D model was first displayed in New York's Mmuseumm in 2016. Qutaish built his project using cardboard, glue, colored pencils and watercolors, and erected not only historic sites such as Aleppo's Citadel — a medieval, fortified palace that's considered one of the oldest landmarks in the world — but also restaurants, gardens, rooftop pools, solar panels and helicopter pads.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/future-aleppo-8215109","date":"June 22","type":"Art Museums","address":"2701 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 22","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 22","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 22","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Her paintings are composed of subtle earth colors, painterly atmospheric passages and gracefully fluid markings. Taub has developed a personal style that effortlessly moves between abstraction and figuration, creating exquisite work that is refined, confident, and strikingly beautiful. Taub works and re-works images, allowing the final painting to emerge out of a controlled chaos. As she builds up multiple layers she will eventually arrive at a finished painting of perfect balance and harmony.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 23","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Henry Taylor at the Line Hotel","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Artist Henry Taylor is often quoted as saying that painting is like \"having a carton of milk in the fridge. It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"June 23","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 23","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

It was only 290 square feet and it had, and still has, a stain glass American flag above the entrance. Andreas Bauer, Christoph Meier, Robert Schwarz and Lukas Stopczynski, all current artists-in-residence at the MAK Center for art and architecture, have built a poor man’s version of the Loos Bar in Mid-Wilshire. Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass. It’s usually full on Friday nights — by 9 or 10 p.m., you can’t move without brushing up against someone else.

It’s an easy pick as he is experiencing a terrible case of writer’s block. He falls asleep, has an orgy (albeit this part a bit blurry), and is at some point drugged. Any which way, his whore/Jiminy Cricket, “F*ck”, is now calling him King Queer and introducing him to his three daughters, “Lady Macbreast”, “Juliewet” and “Beabitch”. It would seem before Shakes wrote the plays we know today; the characters were dreadfully mixed and matched inside his brain. Unbeknownst to you, each character you loved, feared, or hadn’t met yet, once resided in “The Knock Shop-upon-Avon”…or did they? Will “Sexspeare” ever write again? Who is “Ham-on-Rye”?

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 23","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 23","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 24","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 24","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"June 25","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"La Brea Tar Pits","summary":"The world's most famous ice age excavation site also includes the adjoining Page Museum.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination.

Will these women give in to their preconceptions about how the other half lives? Or will they be able to embrace their differences and make a clean start? It’s Beverly Hills vs. Boyle Heights as worlds collide in this raucous comedy.","locationName":"Casa 0101","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/clean-start-8233995","date":"June 25","type":"Performing Arts Theater","address":"2102 E.

Our story unfolds at a fishing lodge in rural Georgia often visited by \"Froggy\" LeSeuer, a British demolition expert who occasionally runs training sessions at a nearby army base. This time Froggy has brought along a pathologically shy young man named Charlie who is overcome with fear at the thought of making conversation with strangers. So Froggy tells everyone that Charlie is from an exotic foreign country and speaks no English. The fun begins when Charlie overhears more than he should — hilarious and damaging revelations made with the belief that Charlie doesn't understand a word of English. The fact that only Charlie and the audience are in on the joke fuels the nonstop hilarity of the play and sets up the wildly funny climax in which things go uproariously awry for the \"bad guys,\" and the \"good guys\" emerge triumphant.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 25","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 25","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Held over three days in June 1967 in Monterey, it was the first American rock festival and the breakout stage for Janis Joplin, Otis Redding and Ravi Shankar, as well as The Who and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, who, as the famous story goes, tossed a coin to see which would perform first. The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 26","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 26","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 27","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Put Your Hands Together","summary":"By Zachary Pincus-Roth Hosts Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher put together a varying lineup of some of L.A.'s best stand-ups.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 27","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

In his characteristically flat, sunny way, he depicts shelves full of plants and pots. Some of the pots are the plain old terracotta kind you’d find at Home Depot. Other colorful, patterned ones look handmade. Sky-blue light shines through the shelves on the right, while those on the left could be in some dimly lit closet. Two pots on the darker side are shaped and painted to look like blinged-out, red-cheeked owls. In time for the holidays, Wood scaled up this painting and applied a slightly altered, vinyl version of it to the street-facing side of MOCA’s Grand Avenue building. So now the outside of the museum depicts a decorative indoor garden.","locationName":"MOCA Grand Avenue","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/jonas-wood-still-life-with-two-owls-7778491","date":"June 27","type":"Art Museums","address":"250 S.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 28","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 28","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose.

The display features approximately 100 items, including journal entries, photographs, personal notes and first editions of her books, especially the 1979 best-selling novel Kindred.","locationName":"Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/octavia-e-butler-telling-my-stories-8073806","date":"June 29","type":"Literature Museums","address":"1151 Oxford Rd.

Held over three days in June 1967 in Monterey, it was the first American rock festival and the breakout stage for Janis Joplin, Otis Redding and Ravi Shankar, as well as The Who and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, who, as the famous story goes, tossed a coin to see which would perform first. The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff. The display is among many 50th-anniversary events happening this year, including the Monterey International Pop Festival in June and the re-release of D.A.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 29","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art?

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 29","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 29","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 30","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 30","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 30","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 30","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Taub works and re-works images, allowing the final painting to emerge out of a controlled chaos.
