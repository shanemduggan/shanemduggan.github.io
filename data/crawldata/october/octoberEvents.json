[{"name":"Alice Waters in Conversation With Jonathan Gold","summary":"By David Cotner If you're wondering how a counterculture kook could somehow transform into a counterculture cook, watch Alice Waters in conversation with L.A. Times food critic Jonathan Gold about her upcoming memoir, Coming to My Senses: The Making of a Counterculture Cook. Waters — founder of Berkeley's Chez Panisse and a big fan of farmers markets — discusses staying true to a larger vision and what she learned from her experiences in the tumultuous '60s amidst all the war, protests and going to jail. The reception includes dishes prepared from Waters' recipes, making the night one to remember on multiple levels.","locationName":"Ann & Jerry Moss Theater, New Roads School","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/alice-waters-in-conversation-with-jonathan-gold-8680288","date":"October 4","type":"Food & Drink","filterType":"Food & Drink","address":"3131 Olympic Blvd. Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-5582","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/ann-and-jerry-moss-theater-new-roads-school-2494383"},{"name":"Gillian Welch","summary":"By Falling James Even when Gillian Welch is billed under her own name, she is always accompanied by her longtime partner, singer-guitarist David Rawlings, much as she often performs with his band Dave Rawlings Machine. Tonight the duo revive Welch’s 2011 album, The Harrow & the Harvest, a triumphant and haunted collection of original folk songs that brought Welch renewed critical attention following an absence of eight years after the release of her previous record. Such tracks as “Scarlet Town” are highlighted almost as much by Rawlings’ spiky shards of acoustic guitar as they are by Welch’s rich, mournful vocals. As its title implies, the love song “Dark Turn of Mind” is weighed down by somber emotions, and similarly stark tunes such as “Tennessee” are marked by the careful, quiet spaces between words as much as they are by Welch’s consoling vocals.","locationName":"The Orpheum Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/gillian-welch-8430486","date":"October 4","type":"Alt-Country Americana Country Folk Rock Singer-Songwriter","filterType":"Music","address":"842 S.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

He wanted to give his neighborhood access to blue-chip art but didn’t quite have the access himself. The museum has that access now. For the past two years, it has been partnering with MOCA and now, as part of “Artists of Color,” a bona fide Flavin sculpture hangs in the space. Across from the Flavin, artist EJ Hill installed something far less cold and spare: cursive blue neon script that reads “We deserve to see ourselves elevated.” Artist Jennie C. Jones used twist ties to make bright red cord loop in on itself, and Joe Goode painted a huge canvas completely purple and placed a milk jar painted the same purple on the floor beneath it. There are plenty of artists of color in this show, a rarity in exhibitions about color-field painting, light and space, and other such form-focused movements. The show aims to survey how artists use and play with color in a wider, more diverse way than usual, and it does so elegantly.","locationName":"The Underground Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/artists-of-color-8403107","date":"October 4","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3508 W.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 4","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

For the past two years, it has been partnering with MOCA and now, as part of “Artists of Color,” a bona fide Flavin sculpture hangs in the space. Across from the Flavin, artist EJ Hill installed something far less cold and spare: cursive blue neon script that reads “We deserve to see ourselves elevated.” Artist Jennie C. Jones used twist ties to make bright red cord loop in on itself, and Joe Goode painted a huge canvas completely purple and placed a milk jar painted the same purple on the floor beneath it.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 5","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

You may recognize \"Convoy's\" trio of performers as the ingeniously helpful losers Swift, Blodget and Gunt from FX's short-lived Terriers.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 5","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 5","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Metal Jazz Night","summary":"By John Payne There was a time when puny minds would have assumed that the terms metal and jazz were mutually exclusive.

Featuring excellent trumpeter Dan Rosenboom, Jake Vossler on guitar, Richard Giddens on bass and Aaron McLendon on human-octopus drums, they’re a heavily political bunch who channel their virtuosic anger through devilishly dense rhythmic and harmonic fury that, if you squint a bit, could be the spiritually skewering sound of Coltrane and Ayler as torn royally asunder by Red-era King Crimson.

This is an understated and quiet album — in the sense that there aren’t screaming fuzztone leads — but Lay’s presence hits tape so completely that it’s almost overwhelming. There’s some of Nick Drake’s slow-burning intimacy, Bridget St. John’s ladder-climbing fingerpicking, even a little of the isolation that hangs from every moment on an album like Gary Higgins’ Red Hash. But that’s just signposting so you know where Lay is taking you: a place that belongs to her, completely.","locationName":"The Love Song","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/shannon-lay-cyrus-gengras-8668530","date":"October 5","type":"Alternative Folk Indie Pop Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"450 S.

Maness’ warm, expressive style — always complementary, never overplayed — made him an in-demand sideman, and he has recorded with everyone from Gram Parsons and The Byrds to Charlie Rich and Waylon Jennings.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible. You get the attention of a personal trainer, have fun, get results, make lasting friends and bond with your little one, for a fraction of the cost. d on KTLA, ABC 7, The Doctors and many publications and sites.

He’s often labeled a country artist for people who don’t like country music, or anointed the savior of country music because of his wide-ranging stylistic interests. But Simpson’s countrypolitan style stretches back to Gram Parson and The Flying Burrito Brothers and, before that, Ray Charles’ experiments in collapsing the boundaries between country and soul music.","locationName":"The Greek Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/sturgill-simpson-8131523","date":"October 6","type":"Country Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"2700 N.

For the past two years, it has been partnering with MOCA and now, as part of “Artists of Color,” a bona fide Flavin sculpture hangs in the space. Across from the Flavin, artist EJ Hill installed something far less cold and spare: cursive blue neon script that reads “We deserve to see ourselves elevated.” Artist Jennie C. Jones used twist ties to make bright red cord loop in on itself, and Joe Goode painted a huge canvas completely purple and placed a milk jar painted the same purple on the floor beneath it.

But the art form began in obscurity and the relative decrease in mass-media attention has allowed it to thrive, returning to its avant-garde roots. The seventh annual Los Angeles Music Video Festival — a weeklong celebration that features a juried competition, a VR showcase and new videos from A Tribe Called Quest, Paramore, Bastille and others — wraps up on Saturday with a closing-night extravaganza. The event culminates with \"Björk: The Music Video Retrospective,\" a look back at the Icelandic singer's stunning visual output over the years; an awards ceremony to honor the weekend's best videos; and an audiovisual collaboration between poet-rapper George Watsky and staunch cohort Carlos Lopez Estrada.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 7","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"International Printing Museum","summary":"By Eve Weston Letterpress printing is enjoying a revival, and the International Printing Museum is Mecca for this retro art, boasting the Ernest A.

He wanted to give his neighborhood access to blue-chip art but didn’t quite have the access himself. The museum has that access now. For the past two years, it has been partnering with MOCA and now, as part of “Artists of Color,” a bona fide Flavin sculpture hangs in the space. Across from the Flavin, artist EJ Hill installed something far less cold and spare: cursive blue neon script that reads “We deserve to see ourselves elevated.” Artist Jennie C. Jones used twist ties to make bright red cord loop in on itself, and Joe Goode painted a huge canvas completely purple and placed a milk jar painted the same purple on the floor beneath it. There are plenty of artists of color in this show, a rarity in exhibitions about color-field painting, light and space, and other such form-focused movements. The show aims to survey how artists use and play with color in a wider, more diverse way than usual, and it does so elegantly.","locationName":"The Underground Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/artists-of-color-8403107","date":"October 7","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3508 W.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 8","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Artists of Color","summary":"By Catherine Wagley When he first opened the Underground Museum back in 2012, artist Noah Davis built a replica of a neon sculpture by revered minimalist Dan Flavin and installed it in his new, raw storefront space.

For the past two years, it has been partnering with MOCA and now, as part of “Artists of Color,” a bona fide Flavin sculpture hangs in the space. Across from the Flavin, artist EJ Hill installed something far less cold and spare: cursive blue neon script that reads “We deserve to see ourselves elevated.” Artist Jennie C. Jones used twist ties to make bright red cord loop in on itself, and Joe Goode painted a huge canvas completely purple and placed a milk jar painted the same purple on the floor beneath it. There are plenty of artists of color in this show, a rarity in exhibitions about color-field painting, light and space, and other such form-focused movements.

Now that the self-titled album has been online and on the streets for a while, you can expect the excitement to grow for this headlining date. Luke Atlas and Coleman Trapp began collaborating as songwriters-for-hire before they formed Coast Modern, and that background is evident as they hit listeners with hook after hook over the course of their album’s 18 tracks.

Disney lost the rights to the character in a contract dispute with Universal Pictures, which continued producing the cartoons until 1943. Historian David Bossert, who was a Disney animator for more than 30 years, uses sketches, photographs, scripts and other archival materials to trace the origins of the little-known rabbit in his new book, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit: The Search for the Lost Disney Cartoons, which he signs tonight.

But the real superheroes of the movie were behind the lens. Oscar-winning Mexican cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's meandering camerawork seemed to float between various storylines, seemingly shot in one long, seamless take. Then there was the almost supernatural score by drummer Antonio Sánchez, who punctuates the soundtrack with free-wheeling jazz drum beats that pop and roll in a frenetic style that mirrors the energy of the antics on screen. At this special performance of CDMX: Birdman Live at Disney Hall, Sánchez performs a solo drum score to accompany the film.

The Virgil feels perfect, big enough that there's a real energy to the room, but cozy enough that bigger acts can feel like they can come here and try out new stuff.\" For more see the rest of our article on the show: Hot Tub at the Virgil. 7 p.m. doors, 8 p.m. show.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 9","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Pete Anderson","summary":"","locationName":"Burbank Moose Lodge","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/pete-anderson-4291208","date":"October 9","type":"Music Blues Jazz Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"1901 W.

Tonight, the author discusses those and more events from his latest autobiography, Logical Family: A Memoir.","locationName":"West Hollywood Library","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/armistead-maupin-discusses-and-signs-logical-family-a-memoir-8694900","date":"October 10","type":"LGBTQ Literature","filterType":"Miscellaneous","address":"625 N.

The band’s more recent efforts, such as 2015’s The Anthropocene Extinction, are relentless assaults of double-bass drumming and guitar work that is equal parts technicality and buzzsaw ugliness, punctuated by vocalist Travis Ryan alternating between some of the most guttural death grunts and heartiest bellows in today’s extreme-metal scene. The band’s lyrical themes and song titles are gross enough to satisfy the more gore-obsessed portion of the genre’s fan base, but Cattle Decapitation’s pro-environment, pro-animal, anti-mankind agenda gives extra color to their musical attack.","locationName":"The Regent Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cattle-decapitation-8690152","date":"October 10","type":"Death Metal Metal Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"448 S.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible. You get the attention of a personal trainer, have fun, get results, make lasting friends and bond with your little one, for a fraction of the cost. d on KTLA, ABC 7, The Doctors and many publications and sites.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 11","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 11","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 11","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

Using his keen talent for focused observation and witty interpretation, Hoekzema has a natural sense when it comes to capturing the essence of his subject. In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings. These are quirky, cheerful and immensely likeable works that will appeal to anyone who appreciates the art of painting.","locationName":"First Independent Gallery (FIG)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/curtis-hoekzema-paintings-6896227","date":"October 11","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., G6 Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-829-0345","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/first-independent-gallery-fig-2184002"},{"name":"The Show","summary":"a hip-hop showcase with performers TBA.","locationName":"Cinespace","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-show-4312246","date":"October 11","type":"Arts & Culture Hip-Hop R&B","filterType":"Art","address":"6356 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90028 323-817-3456","price":"$10","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/cinespace-2198275"},{"name":"Homibing","summary":"Promotional Event Description Let's beat the summer!

Their newest, Mystère (on the formidable Born Bad label), is a cooler and more cinematic effort than 2013’s wild Psycho Tropical Berlin, like a wide-screen, Technicolor spaghetti Western instead of an oversaturated Danger: Diabolik bang-pow action flick. But like any good director, La Femme make great use of negative space, and Mystère displays a sharp new side of their ’60s/’70s/’80s influences. Now it’s rhythm, repetition and hypnotism — and it’ll win you over before you know it.","locationName":"The Regent Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/la-femme-8690151","date":"October 12","type":"Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"448 S.

The sisters are sometimes better known for the soaring harmonies they cast out live over covers of songs by Fleet Foxes, R.E.M., Patti Smith, Bob Dylan, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Leonard Cohen, but most of their albums are filled with their own tunes.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 13","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 13","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"The Los Bar","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Architect Adolf Loos designed his American Bar in Vienna, a fantastic construction with onyx walls and marble floors, in 1903. It was only 290 square feet and it had, and still has, a stain glass American flag above the entrance. Andreas Bauer, Christoph Meier, Robert Schwarz and Lukas Stopczynski, all current artists-in-residence at the MAK Center for art and architecture, have built a poor man’s version of the Loos Bar in Mid-Wilshire. Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass. It’s usually full on Friday nights — by 9 or 10 p.m., you can’t move without brushing up against someone else. Aluminum ashtrays made from melted PBR cans sit on the counter.","locationName":"The Mackey Apartments","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-los-bar-5847342","date":"October 13","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"1137 S.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 14","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

Lindner Collection of Antique Printing Machinery, considered by authorities to be one of the largest, most comprehensive collections of historic graphic arts equipment in the world. Linder regularly rented his antique printing equipment to the movie studios, so there's a chance you've seen some of these presses before, playing a role in Newsies, Bonanza, The Twilight Zone, The Last Samurai, Catch Me If You Can or Seven Pounds, to name a few. Visit the museum and you can get their autograph — really. Museum volunteers run the presses for you, explaining how they work, and, if you're lucky, you might take home a souvenir broadsheet. It's a more personalized experience than most museums around town, and educational too — you'll leave understanding why we designate letters \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase,\" and whence came the oft-bandied about entertainment industry term \"slugline.\" (Only open to the public on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., other times are by appointment)","locationName":"International Printing Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/international-printing-museum-4290963","date":"October 14","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"315 W.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 14","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 14","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

Classical texts were rediscovered at this time, and works like the Corpus Hermeticum, the Hymns of Orpheus, and the Chaldean Oracles (attributed to Zoroaster) were embraced as wisdom literature. Tarot, tarocchi, is a child of the Renaissance and shares many of the characteristics of the cultural and social life of that time. Hermetic Tarot also carries its own consciousness and has accrued even more hermetic and occult characteristics beyond the 17th century and into modern times.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 15","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Tomorrow! With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"October 15","type":"Comedy","filterType":"Comedy","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/trepany-house-at-the-steve-allen-theater-2186233"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week. Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 15","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 15","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Western Frontiers: Stories of Fact and Fiction","summary":"Description from the Autry website: \"This new exhibition illuminates the sweep of American Western history through its definitive artifact: the firearm.\"","locationName":"The Autry","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/western-frontiers-stories-of-fact-and-fiction-4291042","date":"October 15","type":"Art Museums Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"4700 Western Heritage Way Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-667-2000","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-autry-2493948"},{"name":"La Brea Tar Pits","summary":"The world's most famous ice age excavation site also includes the adjoining Page Museum.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

The Grammy Museum's current exhibit, \"Monterey International Pop Festival: Music, Love and Flowers, 1967,\" features co-producer Lou Adler's personal artifacts, in addition to items belonging to Joplin, Hendrix, Shankar, The Grateful Dead and other concert artists and photographs by Henry Diltz, Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal, Elaine Mayes and Ed Caraeff.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 17","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 17","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Victory Lap","summary":"By Jennifer Swann Victory Lap is a variety show, emphasis on the variety: There’s a traditional house band and stand-up comedians (Megan Koester, Brendon Small, Dan St. Germain) between sets, but then there are the weirder things: puppet surgery, tap dancing, busking. Even stranger is what takes place offstage: slow dancing, usually. That’s because at Victory Lap, there’s no separation between performers and audience members, and the latter can purchase raffle tickets for a chance to take the stage and spin a giant wheel that will lead to either humiliation or victory — often, one is the result of the other, and there are plenty of cool prizes as consolation. Tonight’s Halloween-themed shindig is hosted by Dracula (who looks a lot like Victory Lap co-host Seth W. Owen) and the wheel features more frightening challenges than usual. “If it lands on a séance, we’ll have a séance onstage,” producer Sharon Eisman says. “We’re a little nuts.

Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

Using his keen talent for focused observation and witty interpretation, Hoekzema has a natural sense when it comes to capturing the essence of his subject. In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings. These are quirky, cheerful and immensely likeable works that will appeal to anyone who appreciates the art of painting.","locationName":"First Independent Gallery (FIG)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/curtis-hoekzema-paintings-6896227","date":"October 18","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., G6 Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-829-0345","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/first-independent-gallery-fig-2184002"},{"name":"Homibing","summary":"Promotional Event Description Let's beat the summer!

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

Taub works and re-works images, allowing the final painting to emerge out of a controlled chaos.

The museum will host a series of events related to the display, including scavenger hunts, interactive dress-up stations, indoor games and film screenings.","locationName":"The Autry","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/play-8305956","date":"October 19","type":"Family Museums","filterType":"Museum","address":"4700 Western Heritage Way Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-667-2000","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-autry-2493948"},{"name":"\"Transpacific Borderlands: The Art of Japanese Disapora...","summary":"By Siran Babayan As part of the Getty’s city-wide program Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, the Japanese American National Museum hosts this exhibit, which explores artists of Japanese heritage either born or living in Mexico City, Lima or Sao Paulo or in Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 19","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 19","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 19","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals.

Using his keen talent for focused observation and witty interpretation, Hoekzema has a natural sense when it comes to capturing the essence of his subject. In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings. These are quirky, cheerful and immensely likeable works that will appeal to anyone who appreciates the art of painting.","locationName":"First Independent Gallery (FIG)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/curtis-hoekzema-paintings-6896227","date":"October 19","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., G6 Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-829-0345","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/first-independent-gallery-fig-2184002"},{"name":"Homibing","summary":"Promotional Event Description Let's beat the summer!

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 20","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 20","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 20","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 21","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

Lindner Collection of Antique Printing Machinery, considered by authorities to be one of the largest, most comprehensive collections of historic graphic arts equipment in the world. Linder regularly rented his antique printing equipment to the movie studios, so there's a chance you've seen some of these presses before, playing a role in Newsies, Bonanza, The Twilight Zone, The Last Samurai, Catch Me If You Can or Seven Pounds, to name a few. Visit the museum and you can get their autograph — really. Museum volunteers run the presses for you, explaining how they work, and, if you're lucky, you might take home a souvenir broadsheet. It's a more personalized experience than most museums around town, and educational too — you'll leave understanding why we designate letters \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase,\" and whence came the oft-bandied about entertainment industry term \"slugline.\" (Only open to the public on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., other times are by appointment)","locationName":"International Printing Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/international-printing-museum-4290963","date":"October 21","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"315 W.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 21","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum. It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 21","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 21","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 22","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"October 22","type":"Comedy","filterType":"Comedy","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/trepany-house-at-the-steve-allen-theater-2186233"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach.

But you won't have to binge-watch this show and interrupt your shut-eye. Written by Conor Hanney, with music composed by Lee Huff, the musical comedy features cast members Dahlya Glick, Gabe Greenspan, Sylvia Kolb, Madison Lanesey, Callie Ott and Dane Troy, who re-enact the series' entire first season, with its 14 major characters, and sing a dozen original songs inspired by the 1980s in only 75 minutes.","locationName":"El Cid","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stranger-things-the-musical-tribute-8670394","date":"October 24","type":"Comedy Music Television","filterType":"Music","address":"4212 W.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 24","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Visions and Values: Jewish Life From Antiquity to America","summary":"This exhibit of Judaica from the museum's permanent collection shows the history of the Jewish people over 4,000 years.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/visions-and-values-jewish-life-from-antiquity-to-america-4291272","date":"October 24","type":"Arts & Culture Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"2701 N.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 25","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 25","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 25","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Visions and Values: Jewish Life From Antiquity to America","summary":"This exhibit of Judaica from the museum's permanent collection shows the history of the Jewish people over 4,000 years.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/visions-and-values-jewish-life-from-antiquity-to-america-4291272","date":"October 25","type":"Arts & Culture Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"2701 N.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 26","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible.

The museum will host a series of events related to the display, including scavenger hunts, interactive dress-up stations, indoor games and film screenings.","locationName":"The Autry","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/play-8305956","date":"October 27","type":"Family Museums","filterType":"Museum","address":"4700 Western Heritage Way Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-667-2000","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-autry-2493948"},{"name":"\"Transpacific Borderlands: The Art of Japanese Disapora...","summary":"By Siran Babayan As part of the Getty’s city-wide program Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, the Japanese American National Museum hosts this exhibit, which explores artists of Japanese heritage either born or living in Mexico City, Lima or Sao Paulo or in Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 27","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 27","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Andreas Bauer, Christoph Meier, Robert Schwarz and Lukas Stopczynski, all current artists-in-residence at the MAK Center for art and architecture, have built a poor man’s version of the Loos Bar in Mid-Wilshire. Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 27","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"October 27","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

We emphatically welcome films in all genres, from all corners of the world, whether you’re a student or a seasoned filmmaker.

Using his keen talent for focused observation and witty interpretation, Hoekzema has a natural sense when it comes to capturing the essence of his subject. In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings. These are quirky, cheerful and immensely likeable works that will appeal to anyone who appreciates the art of painting.","locationName":"First Independent Gallery (FIG)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/curtis-hoekzema-paintings-6896227","date":"October 27","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., G6 Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-829-0345","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/first-independent-gallery-fig-2184002"},{"name":"Drop-in Meditation Classes","summary":"Drop in for a mid-day rejuvenation with a gentle, guided meditation to calm and clear the mind, let go of tension and get re-focused for the rest of your day.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 28","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"October 29","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 29","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 29","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Visions and Values: Jewish Life From Antiquity to America","summary":"This exhibit of Judaica from the museum's permanent collection shows the history of the Jewish people over 4,000 years.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/visions-and-values-jewish-life-from-antiquity-to-america-4291272","date":"October 29","type":"Arts & Culture Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"2701 N.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

But now I'm booking people who are blowing up in Canada or blowing up in Australia, and it opens up the range,\" says Coccoli, whose new show, Fringe, has been dubbed \"comedy with bangs.\" As with every Fringe show, comedians are encouraged to use wigs and props, while Public House foots the bill for the audience's pizza and beer. A sports bar might be an unlikely place for fringe comedy, but it's all part of the concept, Coccoli says. \"I want it to feel like if Andy Warhol had a weird comedy club in his Factory inside a very bro'd-out bar.\" Public House, 1739 N.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 30","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 30","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Hot Tub with Kurt and Kristen","summary":"By Julie Seabaugh Formerly housed at Littlefield in Gowanus, Brooklyn, the stand-up show Hot Tub has moved across the country and into new digs.

We always want Hot Tub to feel like you discovered something special, and that it's just for you.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"October 31","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"October 31","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Visions and Values: Jewish Life From Antiquity to America","summary":"This exhibit of Judaica from the museum's permanent collection shows the history of the Jewish people over 4,000 years.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/visions-and-values-jewish-life-from-antiquity-to-america-4291272","date":"October 31","type":"Arts & Culture Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"2701 N.

Five finalists will be selected to attend the dinner; one will be awarded a grand prize of $7,500, while the second- and third-place winners will take home $1,500 and $1,000, respectively. All finalists will also receive salsa prize packs. To enter, residents must submit photographs of five original works of art; any form of the visual arts will be considered. Five finalists will be chosen and asked to create one additional piece of art that embodies the LA VICTORIA® brand and its philosophy of the “Modern West Coast Lifestyle.” Be it a Venice Beach scene, a view of the city from Griffith Park, or a Solstice Canyon hike, artists are encouraged to bring their creativity while giving an artistic nod to the LA VICTORIA® brand. The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities.
