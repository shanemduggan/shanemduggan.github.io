[{"name":"Katy Perry","summary":"By Falling James Katy Perry can always be counted on to gambol onstage in colorfully dazzling costumes amid fantastic set designs, and on her current tour for her fifth album, Witness, the Santa Barbara native interacts with a giant pink phone receiver, rides a futuristic purple motorcycle, gets sprinkled on by black-vinyl-clad dancers bearing large shakers of salt and pepper, sings atop a golden pair of dice and stands aloft on an oversize basketball rim. With cameos from such guest stars as Nicki Minaj, Skip Marley and Migos, and songwriting contributions from glittery Canadian duo and tour openers Purity Ring, Witness is simultaneously sensual and playful but driven with more electronic and house-style grooves than Perry’s earlier, more purely pop-minded releases, with just a few hints of the sensitive, acoustic singer-songwriter who used to strum at the Hotel Café.

Born in Spain and raised in Mexico, the vocalist came to international attention in the 1960s as a powerful tenor and much later was part of the massively popular supergroup The Three Tenors with José Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti; they drew a World Series–size crowd at their landmark appearance at Dodger Stadium in 1994. In recent years, Domingo, who is also a conductor and the longtime general director of L.A. Opera, has switched to baritone roles, and his lower and deeper tone should add forceful gravitas when he continues in his titular role as the Babylonian king in director Thaddeus Strassberger's production of Giuseppe Verdi's biblical epic Nabucco.","locationName":"Dorothy Chandler Pavilion","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/la-operas-nabucco-8809556","date":"November 8","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"135 N.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 8","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

Along with other projects involving original compositions steeped in soul, rock dynamics and hip-hop sampling techniques, she’s used her shape-shifting abilities to bring out beautifully unusual angles on just about any new musical turf she traverses.

In 1992, the label went bankrupt and was sold to TVT Records; Nash died in 1995, and Flesher in 2010. Directed by Julia Nash (daughter of Jim), the documentary Industrial Accident: The Story of Wax Trax! Records features interviews with more than 40 former staffers, artists and family, who recall how the store and company popularized the industrial genre in the late '80s and early '90s.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

You may recognize \"Convoy's\" trio of performers as the ingeniously helpful losers Swift, Blodget and Gunt from FX's short-lived Terriers.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 9","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 9","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

His just-out sophomore album, Face Your Fear, is a step forward again, balanced deftly between hope and dread, with subtle and spot-on production by Danger Mouse, Sam Cohen and Harding himself. With The Entire Universe, the new crew including Corners’ Jeffertitti Moon as well as Evan Snyder and Eric Lodwick.

Maness’ warm, expressive style — always complementary, never overplayed — made him an in-demand sideman, and he has recorded with everyone from Gram Parsons and The Byrds to Charlie Rich and Waylon Jennings.

The former celebrates with Cole's 109th Anniversary, a multicourse dinner with live jazz and a best-dressed contest. During four separate dinner seatings, chefs Neal Fraser of Redbird and Christian Page of Cassell's Hamburgers serve up a meal of roast lamb, sides, pie for dessert and, from the bar, two classic cocktails.

Judging by single “Spent the Day in Bed” and recent live teasers, Morrissey’s imminent Low in High School album, while acknowledging his lifelong love of distinctly unhip ’60s female crooners such as Cilla Black and Lulu, incorporates throwback synths, some glam-rock strut and even grungy guitars. But it’s his instinct for earworm melodies and semi-sardonic lyrics that will carry this Morrissey record, just as all those before it.

The museum will host a series of events related to the display, including scavenger hunts, interactive dress-up stations, indoor games and film screenings.","locationName":"The Autry","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/play-8305956","date":"November 10","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"4700 Western Heritage Way Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-667-2000","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-autry-2493948"},{"name":"\"Transpacific Borderlands: The Art of Japanese Disapora...","summary":"By Siran Babayan As part of the Getty’s city-wide program Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA, the Japanese American National Museum hosts this exhibit, which explores artists of Japanese heritage either born or living in Mexico City, Lima or Sao Paulo or in Latino neighborhoods in Los Angeles.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 10","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 10","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass.

At this performance, they’re the featured guests for Echo Flex, a 2000s-themed hip-hop party that should be the perfect setting for the Twins to dust off those old hits and maybe even drop a few recent tunes, such as the rollicking “Miley Cyrus,” that update crunk’s booty-shaking minimalism with the rolling snares and laser-beam synths of today’s club hip-hop.","locationName":"The Echoplex","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/ying-yang-twins-dem-ham-boyz-dj-jeremy-burke-dj-cam-tang-dj-stevie-be-8808200","date":"November 10","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"1154 Glendale Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90026 213-413-8200","price":"$25","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-echoplex-2188068"},{"name":"Unnecessary Evil","summary":"","locationName":"M.i.

Led by French-born choreographer Jacques Heim, the dancer-acrobat-gymnast-daredevils bestrode an expanding collection of giant architectural structures that opened, closed and moved with flexibility that matched the human performers. The company drew national and international attention, including three successive L.A. Phil commissions to music by John Adams, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Philip Glass. Recently, Heim and his cohorts forged a special relationship with the Valley Performing Arts Center with a monumental performance of those three L.A. Phil commissions with live music. To mark Diavolo's silver anniversary, Heim, his troupe and some of those amazing architectural constructs return to campus, taking over various locations for 10 hours brimming with workshops, a dance party and performances, including the premiere of Veteran's Project. The name Diavolo has morphed into the current and descriptive Diavolo/Architecture in Motion, flying higher than when it launched 25 years ago.","locationName":"Valley Performing Arts Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/diavolo-architecture-in-motion-25-year-anniversary-8818600","date":"November 11","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"18111 Nordhoff St. Northridge, CA 91330-8448 818-677-8800","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/valley-performing-arts-center-2196192"},{"name":"Morrissey","summary":"By Paul Rogers Apparently united only by Britishness and mid-1980s career explosions — Morrissey as singer for indie untouchables The Smiths; punky ex–Generation X frontman Idol as a solo artist — this incongruous bill pairs special guest Idol’s swaggering “Rebel Yell” with the headliner’s signature misfit mope. Judging by single “Spent the Day in Bed” and recent live teasers, Morrissey’s imminent Low in High School album, while acknowledging his lifelong love of distinctly unhip ’60s female crooners such as Cilla Black and Lulu, incorporates throwback synths, some glam-rock strut and even grungy guitars. But it’s his instinct for earworm melodies and semi-sardonic lyrics that will carry this Morrissey record, just as all those before it. The paranormally age-defying Idol’s polished, arena-intended hard rock will surely morph the Bowl into a massive sing-along — but the backstage banter between him and Moz remains hard to imagine.

The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 11","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

Tangerine, famously shot on an Apple iPhone, chronicles the efforts of a transgender sex worker (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) to locate her cheating pimp.

With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"November 12","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/trepany-house-at-the-steve-allen-theater-2186233"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 12","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A. Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 12","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"The Sounds","summary":"By Falling James “I thought it was best to keep moving forward/I am the one standing still,” Maja Ivarsson declares forcefully over a surge of Félix Rodríguez’s guitar on “Thrill,” from The Sounds’ recent EP, The Tales That We Tell. The EP’s four songs represent the first new material from the Swedish pop-rock quintet since their 2013 full-length, Weekend. The new tracks literally shift thematically from night (urgent rocker “The Darkness”) into day (the gentle acoustic ballad “Sail Into the Sun”) before culminating in the sleek, Duran Duran–style funk-rock of “Turn to Gold.” As usual, much of The Sounds’ appeal is rooted in the way that Ivarsson’s exuberant, poppy vocals blend with her bandmates’ harder delivery.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 13","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Ari Hoenig","summary":"By Gary Fukushima When he first moved to within a short train ride to New York, drummer Ari Hoenig spent many nights at Smalls, the aptly named Greenwich Village jazz club, where he impressed the likes of saxophonists Joshua Redman and Chris Potter, guitarists Mike Stern, Jonathan Kreisberg and Wayne Krantz, and pianists Kenny Werner and Jean-Michel Pilc — all of whom he would go on to work with. Hoenig became such a fixture at Smalls that he eventually was given every Monday night there to do as he pleased, creating an ongoing showcase for emerging stars such as guitarist Gilad Hekselman and pianist Tigran Hamasyan. With the unique ability to play any multilayered rhythm, Hoenig has become a venerable jazz master within the New York jazz scene and beyond. He celebrates his birthday at Catalina with his new trio, featuring Israeli standouts Nitai Hershkovits (piano) and Or Bareket (bass).","locationName":"Catalina Bar & Grill","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/ari-hoenig-8765940","date":"November 13","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"6725 W.

The EP’s four songs represent the first new material from the Swedish pop-rock quintet since their 2013 full-length, Weekend. The new tracks literally shift thematically from night (urgent rocker “The Darkness”) into day (the gentle acoustic ballad “Sail Into the Sun”) before culminating in the sleek, Duran Duran–style funk-rock of “Turn to Gold.” As usual, much of The Sounds’ appeal is rooted in the way that Ivarsson’s exuberant, poppy vocals blend with her bandmates’ harder delivery.

Mostly, however, it is due to his absolutely stellar debut solo album, As You Were. Gallagher has lost none of his signature vocal abilities or his enviable rock-star swagger.

The coolly grooving and jazzy “Telepathic” warns of the dangers of too much empathy when soaking up everyone else’s feelings.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"November 14","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 14","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Mariachi Tenochtitlán","summary":"","locationName":"Las Hadas","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/mariachi-tenochtitl-n-4290938","date":"November 14","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9048 Balboa Blvd. Northridge, CA 91325 818-892-7271","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/las-hadas-2184825"},{"name":"Visions and Values: Jewish Life From Antiquity to America","summary":"This exhibit of Judaica from the museum's permanent collection shows the history of the Jewish people over 4,000 years.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/visions-and-values-jewish-life-from-antiquity-to-america-4291272","date":"November 14","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"2701 N.

Alongside the likes of Eyehategod, Crowbar pioneered sludge metal by grabbing hardcore punk by the Negative Approach shirt and blending it with the doomy power of Sabbath, Kyuss and Cathedral. The magnificently monstrous results are proof positive that metal doesn’t have to be played at lightning speed in order to be brutally heavy. Band members have come and gone over the years, with frontman Kirk Windstein the only mainstay, but the albums have remained remarkably consistent, right up to last year’s The Serpent Only Lies.","locationName":"Whisky A Go-Go","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/crowbar-tombs-incite-8729856","date":"November 15","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"8901 Sunset Blvd. West Hollywood, CA 90069 310-652-4202","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/whisky-a-go-go-2188142"},{"name":"X: 40 Years of Punk in Los Angeles","summary":"By Siran Babayan Expanded from its original opening date in June, the Grammy Museum finally unveils its latest exhibit, \"X: 40 Years of Punk in Los Angeles.\" A tribute to L.A. music torch-bearers Exene Cervenka, John Doe, Billy Zoom and D.J.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 15","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"West Coast Premier \"Dudes Being Dudes being Dudes!\"","summary":"West coast premier \"Dudes Being Dudes Being Dudes!\" Is a Bro-tasic variety comedy showcase of ladies and gay men dressed up in straight \"dude\" drag.","locationName":"Rafa's Lounge","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/west-coast-premier-dudes-being-dudes-being-dudes-6350066","date":"November 15","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"1836 W.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 15","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

With a voice like a purer, more English Peter Gabriel — but always on the verge of tears — frontman Guy Garvey leads his band from slow-building to all-out storming. Garvey is a poet full of poignant and wrenching lyrics, and his band engulfs his words with lush, dense melodies. On “K2,” he alludes to Brexit with both wit and sorrow: “I’m from a land with an island status/Makes us think that everyone hates us.” Many of the songs have a serene savagery, with soft/hard, rousing choruses that everyone in their adoring crowds sings along to as if they’re auditioning for the band.","locationName":"The Wiltern","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/elbow-8017166","date":"November 16","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3790 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-388-1400","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-wiltern-2184288"},{"name":"A Ciambra","summary":"By Nathaniel Bell The American Cinematheque's annual celebration of Italian cinema launches with a screening of A Ciambra, Italy's official Oscar submission.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"November 16","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"601 S.

You may recognize \"Convoy's\" trio of performers as the ingeniously helpful losers Swift, Blodget and Gunt from FX's short-lived Terriers.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 16","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 16","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

The legendary pedal steel guitarist, who replaced Tom Brumley in Buck Owens’ Buckaroos circa ’69, is an incomparable musician with impeccable taste and an impressive trove of stellar credits. Maness’ warm, expressive style — always complementary, never overplayed — made him an in-demand sideman, and he has recorded with everyone from Gram Parsons and The Byrds to Charlie Rich and Waylon Jennings.

His ongoing Friday night shows at Largo are a great chance to experience the encyclopedic-brained Brion in his purest form. His one-man-band performances typically find him working without a set list, using audience suggestions as a jumping-off point for covers of pop oldies familiar, obscure and often hilariously “wrong,” along with his own supremely crafted original tunes, all done on piano, guitar, drums and loops to genial and beautifully musical effect.","locationName":"Largo at the Coronet","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/jon-brion-7831195","date":"November 17","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"366 N.

Bonebrake, the collection assembles photographs, instruments, clothing, handwritten lyrics by Cervenka and Doe, artwork by Cervenka and concert flyers. The display also includes screenings of W.T.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 17","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 18","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

In recent years, Domingo, who is also a conductor and the longtime general director of L.A. Opera, has switched to baritone roles, and his lower and deeper tone should add forceful gravitas when he continues in his titular role as the Babylonian king in director Thaddeus Strassberger's production of Giuseppe Verdi's biblical epic Nabucco.","locationName":"Dorothy Chandler Pavilion","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/la-operas-nabucco-8809556","date":"November 19","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"135 N.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 19","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Tomorrow! With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 19","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"ASSSSCAT","summary":"By Zachary Pincus-Roth UCB's flagship improv night featuring a rotating cast of UCB greats, such as Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Matt Walsh, Sean Conroy, Lauren Lapkus, Joe Wengert and Zach Woods, plus special guest improvisers and monologist.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

Kurt Braunohler (IFC's Bunk, Chelsea Lately), who co-hosts with Kristen Schaal (Flight of the Conchords, The Daily Show) says of the Virgil, \"It's a relatively new space, there were no other comedy shows there when we decided to do our show (although I think since we announced, a bunch have popped up), it's on a slightly creepy corner, and once you get inside you're pleasantly surprised at how nice it is. We always want Hot Tub to feel like you discovered something special, and that it's just for you. The Virgil feels perfect, big enough that there's a real energy to the room, but cozy enough that bigger acts can feel like they can come here and try out new stuff.\" For more see the rest of our article on the show: Hot Tub at the Virgil. 7 p.m. doors, 8 p.m. show.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 20","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Cool Blue","summary":"","locationName":"Las Hadas","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cool-blue-4290940","date":"November 20","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9048 Balboa Blvd. Northridge, CA 91325 818-892-7271","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/las-hadas-2184825"},{"name":"The Eric Ekstrand Trio","summary":"","locationName":"Colombo's Italian Steakhouse & Jazz Club","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-eric-ekstrand-trio-4290789","date":"November 20","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"1833 Colorado Blvd. Eagle Rock, CA 90041 323-254-9138","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/colombos-italian-steakhouse-and-jazz-club-2182912"},{"name":"Pete Anderson","summary":"","locationName":"Burbank Moose Lodge","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/pete-anderson-4291208","date":"November 20","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"1901 W.

This 4-day workshop will include two days on location (weather permitting) and two days in the studio. Two days will be classroom work working from photographs creating value studies, color studies and creating a painting from the studies and reference material. The plein air painting days will take all the studio study into the field and we will paint from life capturing the natural light. Design and composition, perspective, color mixing, and palette organization will be addressed. After the workshop, artists will have the tools to create paintings that express their vision.

Even stranger is what takes place offstage: slow dancing, usually. That’s because at Victory Lap, there’s no separation between performers and audience members, and the latter can purchase raffle tickets for a chance to take the stage and spin a giant wheel that will lead to either humiliation or victory — often, one is the result of the other, and there are plenty of cool prizes as consolation. Tonight’s Halloween-themed shindig is hosted by Dracula (who looks a lot like Victory Lap co-host Seth W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"November 21","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lora-schlesinger-gallery-2183922"},{"name":"Titicaca: A Two Woman Comedy Show","summary":"","locationName":"Flight Theatre at The Complex","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/titicaca-a-two-woman-comedy-show-6191827","date":"November 21","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"6472 Santa Monica Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90038-1548 323-469-5408","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/flight-theatre-at-the-complex-4285676"},{"name":"X: 40 Years of Punk in Los Angeles","summary":"By Siran Babayan Expanded from its original opening date in June, the Grammy Museum finally unveils its latest exhibit, \"X: 40 Years of Punk in Los Angeles.\" A tribute to L.A. music torch-bearers Exene Cervenka, John Doe, Billy Zoom and D.J.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 22","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 22","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Western Frontiers: Stories of Fact and Fiction","summary":"Description from the Autry website: \"This new exhibition illuminates the sweep of American Western history through its definitive artifact: the firearm.\"","locationName":"The Autry","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/western-frontiers-stories-of-fact-and-fiction-4291042","date":"November 22","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"4700 Western Heritage Way Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-667-2000","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-autry-2493948"},{"name":"Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives","summary":"From the website: \"one of our nation's most important collections of art from Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas...features approximately 250 of the finest objects from the Fowler's collections in a long-term exhibition that celebrates the richness of world arts and considers the roles these works of art play in peoples' lives.\"","locationName":"Fowler Museum at UCLA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/intersections-world-arts-local-lives-4291083","date":"November 22","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"Sunset & Westwood blvds.

While expanding their palates at the same time,” said founder and lead tour guide Tim Maher. “You can really get a feel for the vibe of the neighborhood by seeing what their bars specialize in.” Tours can be reserved at barlinetours.com and will take place on the Expo, Gold, Purple, and Red lines, with stops at several bars and restaurants within walking distance of the respective metro lines. However, the name of the game isn’t speed drinking, it’s working out everyone’s tasting muscles. “Now more than ever, people care about what they are eating and drinking,” says Maher, who has an Environmental Science and Anthropology background, and has spent time bartending at the renowned Father’s Office. “As artisans experiment with new recipes, people get even more adventurous and curious about what they want to eat and drink next.” END","locationName":"Timothy Maher","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/bar-line-tours-8005973","date":"November 22","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"10715 Missouri Ave Apt 305 Los Angeles, CA 90025 760-717-9209","price":"$89","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/timothy-maher-8005972"},{"name":"Titicaca: A Two Woman Comedy Show","summary":"","locationName":"Flight Theatre at The Complex","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/titicaca-a-two-woman-comedy-show-6191827","date":"November 22","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"6472 Santa Monica Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90038-1548 323-469-5408","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/flight-theatre-at-the-complex-4285676"},{"name":"The Show","summary":"a hip-hop showcase with performers TBA.","locationName":"Cinespace","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-show-4312246","date":"November 22","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"6356 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90028 323-817-3456","price":"$10","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/cinespace-2198275"},{"name":"Ocean Exploration","summary":"From the website: \"learn about the history of ocean exploration, current missions, new discoveries, and challenges and opportunities for the future.\" Closed Christmas Day and during the Grand Prix of Long Beach.","locationName":"Aquarium of the Pacific","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/ocean-exploration-4579236","date":"November 22","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"100 Aquarium Way Long Beach, CA 90802 562-590-3100","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/aquarium-of-the-pacific-2184653"},{"name":"You Can’t Stop the Beat: the Art & Artistry of Hairspray...","summary":"The Paley Center for Media welcomes you to the '60s with this dazzling new exhibit.

A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings.

Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

Classes combine strength training exercises, flexibility with cardiovascular drills. Strollers, resistance tubing and your child all play a vital role in the overall full body workout. The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","locationName":"Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"November 23","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lora-schlesinger-gallery-2183922"},{"name":"DW3","summary":"","locationName":"Spaghettini Seal Beach","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dw3-4290828","date":"November 23","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3005 Old Ranch Parkway Seal Beach, CA 90740 562-596-2199","price":"$15","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/spaghettini-seal-beach-2193760"},{"name":"Remarkable Works, Remarkable Times","summary":"Exhibit features 150 rare objects, including the First Folio edition of Shakespeare’s collected plays, the Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the Gutenberg Bible, and Audubon’s masterpiece, The Birds of America.","locationName":"Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/remarkable-works-remarkable-times-4310041","date":"November 23","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"1151 Oxford Rd.

Taub works and re-works images, allowing the final painting to emerge out of a controlled chaos. As she builds up multiple layers she will eventually arrive at a finished painting of perfect balance and harmony. Her finished (and often unfinished) figures pleasantly tease the observer’s eye, suggesting perhaps a pose or a gaze, but leaving final interpretation to the viewer.","locationName":"First Independent Gallery (FIG)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/hilary-taub-recent-work-7552619","date":"November 23","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"2525 Michigan Ave., G6 Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-829-0345","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/first-independent-gallery-fig-2184002"},{"name":"Escapedom","summary":"Did you ever dream of being an FBI agent?

It pays romantic, heavy homage to lots of different things — Voodoo, punk, existential crises, cultural rituals and Care Bears — though mostly it’s about itself. A priestess does a ritual, cursing rolls of film that will later be used to shoot footage we’re watching.

Using his keen talent for focused observation and witty interpretation, Hoekzema has a natural sense when it comes to capturing the essence of his subject. In this exhibition Hoekzema explores a wide variety of subjects, often revisiting works begun earlier, and it is fascinating to see how the artist’s mind works. Angelenos familiar with the Arroyo Seco parkway will immediately recognize how Hoekzema is able to portray the experience of driving along that iconic freeway landscape. A cat lounging in the shade of a tree is the inspiration for investigating the patterning of light and shadows through the foliage and the hatch marks of the tree bark. Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist’s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema’s paintings.

The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 24","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 24","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

Theirs is slightly smaller, since it had to fit into a garage (each artist-in-residence has a narrow, one-car garage as a studio). There’s exposed wood and white lights in place of Loos’s original shiny exterior, mosquito mesh in place of glass.

For its 19-year party, RTB retains a proven format wherein a single, usually local, band enlivens without overly interrupting an array of DJs spinning alt and deathrock faves. While all too many “dark” Angeleno acts lurk in midtempo murkiness, The Wraith are of a more spirited, punky persuasion. Propelled by the tribal-esque expressions of original Blink-182 drummer Scott Raynor, the foursome’s talkative, suitably swirling guitar and bass frame the throaty proclamations of explosively hirsute frontman Davey Bales.","locationName":"Que Sera","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/release-the-bats-5177318","date":"November 24","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"1923 E.

The event is free and open to the public. “Fourth Street’s Retro Row is all about nostalgia, but we are also working to forge a new era along our busy thoroughfare,” Co-President Kerstin Kansteiner, owner of Portfolio Coffeehouse (2300 E. Fourth St.), said. “When I opened Portfolio in 1990, there were only a handful of businesses here, but it’s really become a place where you can spend the whole day — it’s become a thriving business district known throughout the region for it’s funky, vintage vibe,” she said. “There’s so much momentum building here, and we want to keep that going, which is why our shopkeepers have decided to host monthly events in addition to some of our annual favorites, which we will continue doing.” Each month’s Fourth Fridays event will have a theme, and April’s theme will be “The Power of Women,” inspired by a photography exhibit with the same name opening April 28 at The Social List (2105 E. Fourth St.). Walking or biking to the event is strongly encouraged. Additional activities and updates will be posted on social media and online at 4thStreetLongBeach.com.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 25","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 25","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 25","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

Museum of the Holocaust","summary":"By Amanda Lewis Inspired in part by Nam June Paik's video art, the Tree of Testimony consists of 70 television screens of various shapes and sizes piping interviews with Holocaust survivors into the headphones of museumgoers. Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"November 26","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"601 S.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"November 26","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Tomorrow! With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"November 26","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/trepany-house-at-the-steve-allen-theater-2186233"},{"name":"Henry Taylor at the Line Hotel","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Artist Henry Taylor is often quoted as saying that painting is like \"having a carton of milk in the fridge. It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 26","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"ASSSSCAT","summary":"By Zachary Pincus-Roth UCB's flagship improv night featuring a rotating cast of UCB greats, such as Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Matt Walsh, Sean Conroy, Lauren Lapkus, Joe Wengert and Zach Woods, plus special guest improvisers and monologist.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"November 29","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"601 S.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 29","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"November 29","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Noah's Ark at the Skirball","summary":"An exhibit aimed at families that includes a floor-to-ceiling wooden ark and animal sculptures.","locationName":"Skirball Cultural Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/noahs-ark-at-the-skirball-4291271","date":"November 29","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"2701 N.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

Taub works and re-works images, allowing the final painting to emerge out of a controlled chaos.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"November 30","type":"","filterType":"Miscellanous","address":"3006 W.

The classes emphasize strength and stability while offering personalized fitness throughout the class. Baby Boot Camp is more than a fitness program. It is a support program for moms and families in a warm and welcoming environment. The benefits go well beyond the physical. We have been credited for helping moms combat postpartum depression/baby blues, form lasting friendship and live a healthier lifestyle. We have Mom’s Night Out, Playdates, and fun activities for moms, kids and the whole family. It’s a great opportunity for moms to meet other moms, get out of the house, build healthy friendships and set great examples for their kids. Kids are more likely to live a healthy lifestyle if they see their role model (you) doing it. What makes us different from other programs? • All our classes are taught by nationally certified instructors so our programs are safe AND effective. • We are results oriented. We will help you reach your goals. There is definitely more boot than stroll. • We are loved and supported by health professionals and hospitals including Torrance Memorial Maternal/Child Health. • The Value is incredible.

The finalists will exhibit these works at the celebration dinner. “We’re excited to connect our iconic brand with local fans as a way to honor LA VICTORIA® Brand’s past, celebrate the present, and inspire the future,” said LA VICTORIA® Brand Manager Sebastian Friedman. “Our art contest is just one of several ways we are paying tribute to our West Coast roots and the authentic culinary traditions we’ve inspired for now a century.” The celebration in Los Angeles will take place Thursday, June 1, at the Santa Monica Pier and Carousel. In addition to showcasing the artwork of the contest finalists, the brand will partner with Eddie Ruiz, renowned chef at Corazon y Miel in Long Beach, to honor Mexican-American culture and tradition while celebrating LA VICTORIA® Brand’s modern, West Coast approach. The San Diego dinner occurs on May 11, and following the Los Angeles event, the makers of the LA VICTORIA® brand will travel to San Francisco and Portland to continue the festivities. For Official Rules or to enter the art contest, visit http://lavictoria.com/100Years during the entry period and submit five works of art and other requested materials.
