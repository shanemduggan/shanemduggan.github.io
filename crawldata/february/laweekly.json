{"events":[{"name":"Bonsai-a-Thon Bonsai-a-Thon","summary":"By Siran Babayan Bonsai is the Japanese art form of landscaping miniature trees in shallow containers. The Huntington Library's bonsai garden holds hundreds of juniper, elm, pine and other such trees, some more than 1,000 years old. The museum's annual Bonsai-a-Thon invites visitors to both admire and learn about its bonsai collection over two days. Saturday includes a beginner's workshop (advance registration required), while Sunday features a behind-the-scenes tour of the bonsai nursery. Both days offer a bonsai exhibit, guided tours, demonstrations led by experts, live auction, raffle and vendors selling tools, pots and trees.","location":"@ Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/bonsai-a-thon-7933912","date":"February 26","address":"1151 Oxford Rd.

The unofficial meetup encourages fans of Hollywood's classic era to dress up as their favorite celeb — from Clark Gable to Clara Bow — although dressing as one of the celebs whom paid impersonators play at the park, like Lucille Ball or Marilyn Monroe, is discouraged. It's all pretty loose, but costumed participants can keep up with one another and photo ops by following @OldHollywoodDay on Instagram. Best part about being a regular person on Oscars Day? You can actually eat.","location":"@ Universal Studios Hollywood","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/old-hollywood-day-meet-up-7945070","date":"February 26","address":"100 Universal City Plaza Los Angeles, CA 91602 818-622-3801","type":"Arts & Culture Recreation"},{"name":"Comedy InvAsian Comedy InvAsian","summary":"","location":"@ Japanese American National Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/comedy-invasian-7894710","date":"February 26"},{"name":"\"Carrie\" That Tune: Hit Songs from Flop Musicals \"Carrie\" That Tune: Hit Songs from Flop Musicals","summary":"","location":"@ Au Lac","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/carrie-that-tune-hit-songs-from-flop-musicals-7833238","date":"February 26"},{"name":"America's Shakespeare: The Bard Goes West America's Shakespeare: The Bard Goes West","summary":"","location":"@ Los Angeles Central Library","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/americas-shakespeare-the-bard-goes-west-7576930","date":"February 26"},{"name":"The Science Behind Pixar Exhibition The Science Behind Pixar Exhibition","summary":"","location":"@ California Science Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-science-behind-pixar-exhibition-7463530","date":"February 26"},{"name":"Inaugural Chicana/o Latina/o Printmaking Summit Inaugural Chicana/o Latina/o Printmaking Summit","summary":"","location":"@ Self Help Graphics & Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/inaugural-chicana-o-latina-o-printmaking-summit-7927802","date":"February 26"},{"name":"The Collectivists The Collectivists","summary":"","location":"@ Brand Library & Art Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-collectivists-7809212","date":"February 26"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...
