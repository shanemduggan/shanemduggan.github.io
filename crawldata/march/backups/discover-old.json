Bobcat’s off-the-beaten-path style of creating movies allows audiences to experience films that other artists may have never dared to attempt.

Armenians who survived the Armenian Genocide began migrating to the area as refugees. Each quarter was populated by natives from a village in their original homeland which re-gifted its name to the new quarter such as Marash, Nor-Adana, and Nor-Sis. Erecting schools, churches, cultural centers and maintaining political affiliations with concerted national codes, it was here where national identity was resurrected as a means to hold on to what was violently ended in the homeland. Between 1975 and 1995, the district witnessed drastic population shifts as a result of the Lebanese civil war. Most Armenian inhabitants of the quarter fled the country and others moved out of the area to better their social ranking.

The six tracks perfectly showcase his intelligent wordplay and social commentary that he has become synonymous for. The palpable sense of excitement has seen his debut UK headline tour sell out within 30 minutes after going on sale, not to mention gaining famous friends such as Drake who recently remixed the track Wanna Know. He made his debut appearance on Black Box, a YouTube channel for freestyle rap in May 2015. That November he performed on SB.TV’s “Warm Up Session”. This is a multi-faceted British company with its own YouTube channel specializing in urban music, as well has interviewed Prime Minister David Cameron and HRH Prince Charles. He has performed on BBC Radio 1 Charlie Sloth’s show “Fire in the Booth”, which is regarded as a real mark of prestige in the scene. He has already performed at Bestival, a four-day award winning music festival that has been held annually since 2004. In addition, he was a part of the Red Bull Music Academy UK tour last October (a world-traveling series of music workshops and festivals, founded in 1998. The main five-week event is held in a different city each year. The public portion of its program is a festival of concerts, art installations, club nights and lectures by influential figures in contemporary music). Summer 2017 will see Dave perform at prestigious European festivals including Glastonbury, Wireless and Reading & Leeds (UK), Appelsap (Netherlands), Melt Festival (Germany) and Secret Solstice (Iceland).","location":"The Roxy","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/dave-x-aj-tracey-0","locationAddress":"9009 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles 90069, us\\","date":"March 19","type":" / Music      "},{"name":"Yellowcard","summary":"An American pop punk band that was formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1997 and based in Los Angeles since 2000.[5] The band is well known for its singles \"Ocean Avenue\", \"Only One\", and \"Lights and Sounds\".

Moody, evocative, stormy, and brimming with life. Signing space is limited to purchasers of Häxan.Performing at The Getty Center on 3/21.In between the release of Dungen’s most recent two albums (2010’s Skit i allt and 2015’s Allas sak), the beloved Stockholm quartet was asked to create an original score to Lotte Reiniger’s 1926 touchstone The Adventures of Prince Achmed, understood to be the oldest surviving full-length animated feature film. Inspired by the work and the characters – Prince Achmed, Peri Banu, Aladdin, the Sorcerer, and most of all, the Witch – the members of Dungen immersed themselves into the groundbreaking visual language of this landmark silent film.Häxan (translation: “The Witch”) is Dungen’s first all-instrumental album. Produced by Mathias Glavå, and recorded, mixed, and edited by hand to tape entirely in the analog domain, Häxan was sequenced away from the linear narrative of the film. This process helped to create a path of its own, fully capturing the rawness and spontaneity present in the sessions, as well as a loose, abstract, and fragmented collage feel, evident in the dense and dissonant free-form rock-outs, haunting ambient passages, and gorgeously cinematic soundscapes present in the work, a record that stands on its own outside of the presence of its primary inspiration.Moody, evocative, stormy, and brimming with life, Häxan provides both a tacit summation of the Dungen journey up to today, and gives the beloved group a chance to stretch out like never before.","location":"Amoeba Hollywood","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/dungen-live-performance-signing-free-all-ages","locationAddress":"6400 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles 90028, us\\","date":"March 22","type":" / Music      "},{"name":"Funk Jazz Wednesday","summary":"ALL SEATS MUST ARRIVE BY 7PM.

Reception to follow.  ARA MADZOUNIAN was born in Bourj Hammoud in 1953. He lived there for 20 years until the start of the civil war in 1975. He is an independent producer, director and cinematographer based in Los Angeles. He holds a BA and MFA in Film & Television from UCLA. For eight years he has produced Armenia Fund Telethon. He has also produced educational videos for Los Angeles County Refugee Project. He made his screen-acting debut on ShowTime in Radio Inside, a feature film. Ara has lectured on Armenian Cinema at the ARS Summer Studies Program at Amherst and Bradford colleges in Massachusetts. He has produced and directed over thirty television commercials and many corporate films. His latest feature cinematography work Meltdown was released in 2015. Ara is currently working with the Smithsonian Institution on a project that harnesses the power of storytelling to strengthen cultural heritage sustainability called My Armenia.   The Bourj Hammoud district in Lebanon is the geographical extension of Beirut City along the Mediterranean coastline. It constitutes the suburb immediately east of the capital, by the seaside-separated by the Beirut River. Housing a population of roughly 100,000 persons, it is a dense working class district, extending over an area of 0.96 square-miles or 2.4 km2 within the Greater Beirut municipality.  Until the early twentieth century, Bourj Hammoud was an area characterized by agriculture and marshlands, scattered with individual settlements. After 1928, Armenian refugees who survived the Ottoman persecutions began migrating to the area, settling in compact quarters organized into regular gridiron patterns. Each quarter was populated by natives from a village in their original homeland in Anatolia, modern day Turkey, which re-gifted its name to the new quarter such as Marash, Nor-Adana, and Nor-Sis.  In the mid nineteen-forties, part of the Armenian population migrated to Soviet Armenia, followed by another influx of migrants from south Lebanon-mainly Shiites and some Palestinians, whom settled predominantly throughout the southeastern edges of the district. In the sixties, Bourj Hammoud witnessed an influx of Armenians from Syria, mainly Aleppo, who settled in the area and established their small businesses.  Between 1975 and 1995, the district witnessed drastic population shifts as a result of the Lebanese civil war’s ongoing development. The influx of displaced populations from conflict zones and hostile areas, and emigrants from rural areas-mainly Armenians from Beirut and Christians displaced from their villages, coupled with the displacement of Shiite inhabitants, progressed the continual densification of Bourj Hammoud’s population.  My parents, both survivors of the 1915 Armenian genocide, met and were married in Damascus, Syria, only to relocate their family to Bourj Hammoud in 1949. It is here I was born and lived there for 20 years before permanently moving out at the start of the civil war in 1975.  Bourj Hammoud became a safe haven for many Armenians who were forced to leave their homes and subsequently converge in this one square mile territory to create a home away from home. Erecting schools, churches, cultural centers and maintaining political affiliations with concerted national codes were a part of the effort to maintain a level of subsistence. It was here, also, where national identity was resurrected as a means to hold on to what was violently ended in the homeland. From 1935 to 1985 this tiny enclave served as the cultural, intellectual and political beacon of the Armenian Diaspora.  During the course of a 15-year conflict, most Armenian inhabitants of the quarter fled the country and others moved out of the area to better their social ranking. Today, like many dwindling Christian communities across the Middle East, Bourj Hammoud struggles to retain its Armenian character against the tide of political uncertainty engulfing the region. More than 50 years Bourj Hammoud played a pivotal role in preserving the Armenian national identity. This important place-often called Little Armenia-this colony is the last bastion of Armenian collective memory as it is a direct consequence of a crime against humanity perpetrated over hundred years ago against Armenian population living in their homeland.  Between 2008-2009, I returned to my hometown twice to be with my terminally ill older brother who had lived all his life in Bourj Hammoud. The district has gone through dramatic changes; not only in terms of becoming an important commercial hub but also due to the migration of its predominantly Armenian population, whose distinctive mark of character is disappearing from the area.  Each resident of this suburb can offer a plethora of interesting and enchanting stories-in this book are only some of the many images captured during my visit to this special place. My intimate relationships with its narrow streets, the sights and sounds, and its peculiar characters have all been an important source of inspiration all my life.  This book is my story, a tribute to all residents of Bourj Hammoud.","location":"Roslin Art Gallery","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/meet-ara-mazdounian-author-birds-nest","locationAddress":"415 E.
